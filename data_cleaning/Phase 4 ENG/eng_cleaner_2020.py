Please, stay in silence, in prayer and contemplation, do not speak. Did you want to see the signs of the end times? The signs have come and you still do not believe, you were told that apostasy would enter the Church because of proud, selfish theologians and this has happened, upsetting the words of My Gospel. I told you of famines, plagues and diseases that would come and you still do not believe. I told you, rumblings of war will be heard, here they are, everything is already revealed in the Bible (Revelation of John), state against state, governments against governments, men against men, you are afraid of each other, they have taken away your freedom and you still do not believe. Oh! how much faith will I find when I return! Yet, how many trials you could overcome with faith and by praying the Holy Rosary. My children, trust and entrust yourselves and I will be with you always, follow in my footsteps and take my hand and I will be with you every day until the end.

My children, on the other hand, God is asking you for humility; this is the virtue that will make you recognize yourselves as His children. Now is the time for the real battle and with the weapons of fasting and the Holy Rosary on your hands, fight together with Me for the Triumph of My Immaculate Heart. Beloved children, the times that will come will be terrible, but do not fear, for My Son and I will be close to you in the tribulation. Jesus will send down the Holy Spirit upon you, just as He did with His apostles. My children, ambassadors and prophets of these times, will suffer more than anyone else, do not leave them alone.

My children, do not be like the foolish virgins, fill your lamps at once and light them. My children, remember that silence will lead you to perdition, so cry out and be no longer in silence. Sing Praises and Hymns to the Lord, do not fear, but be courageous. Accepting even the slightest change in the Word of God will be like accepting everything, be vigilant.
