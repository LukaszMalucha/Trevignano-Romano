"While I was with my husband lying on the bed watching TV, I hear a voice calling me. I asked my husband to turn down the volume of the television and as I turned to the statue placed on the dresser, I saw the Madonna wrapped in a white veil and a blue / light blue cloak. In tears I said to my husband: the little Madonna! Our Lady! and instinctively we both kneel at the foot of the bed. Smiling, she said to me: My daughter, I am the Holy Virgin, do not be afraid, I have chosen you because you are full of love and hope and on this life must be founded. I will send you many people who need to be converted, do not close the doors but open them so that everyone can see and learn to love my Son Jesus. I will return soon and they too (referring to my family) will feel my presence with a sign of me. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. At the end of the apparition, all my family members in the house heard the sound of bells. "
"My daughter, my heart suffers from injustice, the lack of trust in the signs that God sends you from heaven. Faith is also shown by accepting the Lord with humility and trust. Listen to what God tells you and do not resist the call of him. Meditate! This mother wants to pour out her love for you to prepare your heart for her, her Son. Accept my blessing and my protection. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My daughter, do not despair, I will follow you. Help others to pray, to get closer to God the Creator. My heart is bleeding because we are close by now and the Church is very confused and clouded. Remember, only with prayer will you have eternity. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My daughter, the three days of darkness are about to arrive. It will be a very cold night. Do not be afraid, because whoever believes in my Son will be saved. I insist on asking to recite the rosary and whoever teaches it to others will have his head covered with pearls of mercy and glory for all the souls he will have saved. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My daughter, tell the Bishop not to stop fighting. He must pray for the world, because Satan will not stop taking all souls even close to him. Do not worry, your family has my blessing, but you too will have to fight for the prayers that I ask you and above all for the conversions, I will always be next to you. I cry for the wrong decisions that the rulers are making and for the Church, which is in great difficulty; especially the Pope, pray for them so that the choices they make will only be decided by the heart. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, I recognize your pains, pray and I will be close to you. Pray to Jesus and you will be victorious. Pray for those who don't believe. Do not stop, there are many people who need to redeem themselves and all your suffering will not be lost. Don't stop praying. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. On this occasion, Our Lady prayed in Aramaic on all present during the recitation of the Holy Rosary. "
"Dear children, I thank you and I am very happy because you are gathered here also today. You are my Apostles. Do not be tempted by Satan because he is strong, but with prayer you will overcome him. Jesus gives you his blessing, together with me, your mother. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. During the recitation of the Holy Rosary, Our Lady held little Jesus in her arms then at the end, opening her arms, she wrapped us all with her heavenly mantle giving her Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My daughter, I am happy to be here. There must be conversion because God is in a hurry. Your names are engraved in my Immaculate heart and each one will have their own reward for having favored my plans. Do not be afraid. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, thank you for being here more and more numerous. I will touch you one by one, so that you can bring my blessing to the needy and to your families. Love my Son because it is He who sends me to touch the earth. Kneel and be humble. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, thank you once again for being here with me. Thank you for looking for me. Thank you for welcoming me here in your heart. Love my Son because he is the only truth. You are on the right path, I will thank you very much to give you a sign of my presence. Thank you, my apostles. With your mother's heart you will receive my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, I am still very happy today because you have answered my call in your heart. Please, there is no more time, get converted and say the rosary. Do not resist my call, pray for the priests who are lost, they are blind and deaf. Tell them to go to homes and to the streets for the salvation of as many souls as possible. I love you and if only they all knew how great my love is for you! Jesus forgives you for your sins and I again with my son, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Then he adds: After France it will be Rome where there will be a great earthquake. The Vatican will suffer great pain. Within it at this moment there are Cardinals and Bishops who will be forced to choose the path of evil by moving away from the only truth that leads to the Father. Listen to the winds of war. Russia is preparing. Pestilence, misery and smallpox will fall on Rome, which will give death and despair. At the end of this message, Our Lady points to the sun, and I realize that it turned on itself several times. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here and thank you to the people who have accepted my call today. Remember that only the truth will set you free. Pray the Our Father with me three times. Pray for the priests, for the Pope, for the bishops and cardinals, so that my light can touch their hearts. I will give signs of my presence to those who do not believe. Thank you, my apostles, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. On this occasion Our Lady added: pray for the Pope, because his pontificate will be short. In the three days of darkness, take some blessed candles, those who keep them lit will not be touched by the demons. My daughter, help me for the conversion of my children; I know that you and your husband are the ones I would like next to me for my requests and I know that you will complete the task I have entrusted to you. Thank you, my children, your Mother."
"My children, thank you for still being here today. It allows the luminous rays of my Son to enter your hearts. I say and I keep repeating: 'be humble, not only during prayer, but every day'. When you pray, it is not necessary to name the people you care about one by one, because I know your needs, one by one, and the names of the people dear to you. I thank you and together with Jesus, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, dear children… thank you for still being here, many even today… I am very happy. Someone wonders why my apparitions take place during the Rosary. The answer is simple, because I am the Queen of the Rosary. My daughter, you and your spouse must be the example for all couples, this is why I have chosen you, for the great Love and for the great Peace that you have in your hearts; because unfortunately the devil has infiltrated families and destroyed them. The strength of the Rosary is the winning and powerful weapon. My children, pray for the Pope, because he is forced to make decisions that do not come from his heart. Please intensify the Rosaries because times are very tight. There is no more time. Thank you, my apostles. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. On this occasion the picture of Divine Mercy exuded abundantly in front of all present, arousing amazement and devotion. A very strong testimony to the attention of all present. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to your Mother's call. I am here because Jesus sent me. Don't be afraid, my messages are not defeatist. I want you to believe in the one God and to embrace the cross of my Son. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Thank you, my children for having responded to my call in your heart. There are so many new people today. I will dry your tears and will not allow satan to attack you. Pray the Holy Rosary. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Thank you, my children, today the young people are here in this blessed house. I love you all. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. On this occasion, during her apparition, Our Lady asked Gisella to give her a caress for her to all present. "
"Dear children, I am very happy because you are many even today ... but today I am also a little sad, because some of you have a hard heart, I have given you many graces but you still do not understand my presence. I take you by the hand, but keep making mistakes, do not be touched by the pitfalls. Take the Eucharist because my Son is there. Then praying over all present, he said: Bring my Blessing to your families, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Thank you for the presence of young people, today I ask you for peace and love for your brothers and for the needy. I ask you to love yourselves, as my Son did with his brothers. My Son is very close and you will see him descend from a great white cloud. Please my children, tighten the Rosary which is the only weapon to defend yourself from evil. For every Hail Mary said with the heart, I will make a Grace! I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. On this occasion, the Queen of the Rosary asked to divulge the messages received so far, so that all people can meditate. "
"Dear children, I thank you again for the new people, for the call you have felt in your heart. Thank you for having gathered here again today, the Lord gives you Grace, the gift of wisdom, hope, knowledge, but you must listen to the message of Jesus, you must open your hearts. I cry for the hard times that are waiting for you, have courage, I am close to you and I will always be to protect you from all evil. Do not be far from me, because I love you and I would very much like the greatest desire to be to take you to my Kingdom, to my new world on this earth. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, I thank you for having accepted my call once again in your hearts… it is addressed above all to new people who have made a great effort to reach Gisella's house; someone didn't even want to be there, but she once again insisted blowing into their hearts. Our Lady asked us to cling once again to the Holy Rosary and to prayer, because it is the only powerful and strong weapon to defeat Satan continually hunting for souls and adds: Jesus is praying to his Father, so that he can free us as soon as possible and make nothing happen and that the Earth can purify itself only with prayer and love. But even this becomes difficult because God is tired ... God is tired! Our Lady also added that a great World War is brewing and that we must be calm and we must pray a lot because She is here to protect us and not to frighten us. Those who love her Son and those who pray the Rosary will be saved. She asked never to stop, and finally she blessed all the rosaries of those present. She blessed us all, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your hearts and for being gathered here in this blessed house. Open your hearts so that the Holy Spirit can infuse Peace upon you. Always pray because with your prayers, you can alleviate your pains and those of other faithful for the days of tribulation that await you. The Earth is about to tremble, Brazil will soon drink from the bitter cup. I will be beside you and I will take you by the hand one by one, continue to pray the Rosary because it is the strongest and most powerful weapon. In this apparition under the feet of the Madonna the world could be seen, wrapped in blood and by many people who invoked help towards the Lord; but the Queen of the Rosary says: ... for those who did not have faith it will be useless, at the last moment, to invoke the Lord, because he will not be saved! At the end of this apparition, the luminous rays around the figure of Mary touched all the sick present and She blessed everyone in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "
"Dear Children Thank you for being here. Thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. The angels are waiting for my command to come down and withdraw you without realizing it, you will find yourself on a new earth and you will see great wonders. I insist on asking you to recite the Rosary, I myself will go down with the angels to hold you by the hand. The Holy Virgin was full of luminous rays, she sent the Blessing down on everyone present like a shower of luminous and colored confetti, then she blessed everyone in the name of the Father in the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Today Our Lady was also very happy for the presence of the Bishop and for the new young people who came for the first time and she said: the paths that I trace on your path cannot be diverted. I have blown into the hearts of many people and I thank you for hearing my call in your hearts. I ask you to pray for Chile and America. Today I finally have my Son among us. Scientists are gagged by the powerful. She asks us to go ahead and recite the Holy Rosary. Then she attended the recitation of a Hail Mary with us and blessed us in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Today Our Lady was dressed in white with a crown of stars and said: My dear Apostles, thank you for being gathered here and for having heard my call in your heart I know your pains your anxieties but if you are faithful to my Son, he will turn them into real joy. Many of you come to seek faith but open your hearts and there you will find the answers. Today my Son is among you, then he has opened his arms and his mantle is spread as if to protect us and he blessed all present in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"I and my family were invited to a friend's house. We had arrived at dinner time to celebrate August 15th and while we were talking at the table, I felt the presence of the Blessed Mother and raising her eyes to the sky she appeared dressed in white with a luminous crown and a blue mantle with a red heart in her hand. She gave off a great light. Our Lady said: Dear children, I pray for the reconciliation of your families and I pray for the Graces before the Holy Trinity. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, I am very happy because you are numerous and because you have answered the call in your heart. Soon my Son will reveal the third Seal (in the vision that Our Lady represented for me I saw a knight dressed in black with a sword and a black horse who sowed famine, death and despair). The only weapon you will have will be prayer and the Holy Rosary, stock up on canned food and drinking water because the demons will try to take everything away from you. My Son is marking his disciples so that no one can be approached by the demons. Trust him, I will always protect you. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. During the apparition, Our Lady caressed all those present one by one. "
"Even today Our Lady is among us and said: Dear children, I thank you for having listened to the breath of my call in your hearts, thank you for being here more and more numerous, I know that your brothers are here to ask for graces and to ask for conversions, I hope that the fire of the Holy Spirit can invade your body and your heart, I love you as a mother, I love you as your mother, because I am your mother, so please love my Son as He loves you, asks for forgiveness, asks to forgive and to know how to ask forgiveness from others just as God has forgiven so many of you. Our Lady then says: Pray for France because it will face yet another strong pain. Pray for Italy especially for Rome because the forecasts are not good, pray for Chile, the earth will tremble again and volcanoes will start to erupt one after the other in all parts of the world. I insist on asking you to pray, to convert before it is too late. I thank the consecrated to GOD who finally opened his heart, and that was what I wanted. Unfortunately, there is not much time for any of us and therefore I really ask you to open your hearts to Jesus, come close to my Son, love him and give him all your sufferings, embrace your cross and he will change them into joy, do not wait at the last moment to do it. Be my Apostles, do not go in search of signs but of prayers with an open heart and I will listen to you, as well as my Son, I intercede every day with my Son. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear Children Thank you for being gathered here in the Father's house, you are about to experience something very great, the end of time has begun. Listen to the earthquakes of the world, this is the shock to your consciences. My Son asks for your sincere so do not be hypocrites, I am here once again to ask you to draw near to Him. Whoever believes in the only God will be Sanctified, but whoever moves away will be cursed. Thank you, my beloved children, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear daughter, this is the hour of your tribulation and every time I appear, I will give great graces. Let yourself be infused by the Holy Spirit of my Son so that hatred, anguish and fear do not touch you when Satan will give you pain just because you all pray to my Son. I love you and he is giving you a beautiful grace, do not be blind. Please, my children, let him sign you to be all together in the new earth that he has prepared for you. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for hearing my call in your heart. Thank you for being gathered here and how much faith I feel in my sons today. Today I leave you a mission, pray for the souls who must be converted so that they are worthy of the New Earth of my Son. My daughter, say a Hail Mary and today too many graces will descend. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

You are my little children and I love you, remember that I am the Queen of the Church, of that Church that is being lost, pray for the priests so that they do not get lost in the hypocrisy of prayer. My children, open your hearts and get converted, I will always be at your side protecting you. Thank you, my children, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "
"Dear children, thank you for always being gathered here with me, the secrets of Fatima are on everyone's heads, yet there is total indifference towards my messages. Help people to convert, there is not much time, yet the wars that are in the world should make everyone understand everything and instead many believe that everything will settle down and go on as if nothing was happening. Listen to the approaching rain of the Father's wrath. Don't think that the Vatican is doing good things for humanity, it's all false. Many men of the Church are false, the few holy priests will be persecuted as well as the people of God. My daughter, do not trust and follow in detail only what I ask of you. Thank you, my children for your 'Yes' every day, I will be next to you to console and protect you.

I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being gathered here in this blessed house.

Thank you, my daughter. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Pray for the Japan and Chile where the earth will soon tremble. Bring my blessing to your families and I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for coming here to this blessed house. You are a small portion of the church, my children we are here now, the days of the warning have arrived soon you will see my Son coming from heaven on a cloud and a loud roar will make the earth tremble. He will come to gather all the children of God and he will forgive you of all sins. A great sign will be a cross visible throughout the world, do not be afraid, I will be with you and I will take you by the hand but you embrace the Heart of Jesus and his cross. Our Lady asks us to recite the Our Father with her. Our Lady adds: do not cover the signs that Jesus leaves you, make sure that everyone can see the love of my Son's passion.

"Dear children, how much hypocrisy and coldness I feel in prayer, this is the hour when the evil one is taking over my Son's church. I order you my daughter to help me spread prayer and save as many souls as possible. The time has come for the choice that will change the world, there is no more time. Say a prayer for the priests who are being lost and for those who are far from God. Thank you, my beloved daughter. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being gathered here and thank you for having responded to my call. Pray for the priests who are in great confusion and this will lead them to perdition. The new earth is ready, full of lilies and flowers and waiting for you. Stay close to my Son and love him, only he and the truth, love and salvation.

Adored children I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Take my blessing to your families. "
"Dear children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer.

My children, open your heart and let yourself be carried away by the love of my Son. May my blessing be upon you and your families. Pray for Canada where the forces of evil are preparing and pray for Central America where there will be a major earthquake. "

Open your heart to his infinite love, feed on the body of my Son. Pray so that we can eradicate a disease for which there will be no cure.

"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, I am very sorry for your pains and tribulations, but ask yourselves, what did my Son do that was so bad?

Beloved children, unfortunately the time of tribulations has already begun, but I will never abandon you! Open your hearts and pray, pray, pray.

"Beloved children, thank you for gathering here again tonight. Pray a lot for the Church and for consecrated children. Soon the Church of Peter will be destroyed by those who are approaching. Dear daughter, I want you to talk to the holy priests, asking them to teach children the true catechism, to teach that the Devil exists and to explain who this crafty angel of hell really is. By now Protestantism is pressing in the Church and many no longer believe that my living Son is in the Eucharist. Soon they won't even recognize me as the Immaculate Virgin conceived without sin. Beloved daughter, how many will suffer for these sins. How many prelates, cardinals and bishops are taking the path of perdition! Help them understand that my Son and the Gospel are the only truth and life. You will soon be forced to return to pray in your homes. Cling to the daily recitation of the Holy Rosary, which is the only shield that will protect you from evil. I will always be next to you whenever you invoke my name. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for hearing my call in your heart. My little ones, I cry for you and for all that you will see, do not cry for the dead, they already see the great light.

I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart, above all I am referring to the new people who are gathered here in prayer. Pray, my children, pray because Satan will not give you truce by dividing you and the Church, but you people of faith do not fall into this trap, be just and bear witness with courage. Love each other as God loves you. Dear children, look at what is happening around you, earthquakes, tsunamis and avalanches, we are at the end of time, so do not waste time, convert. I love you, do not be afraid, I will always protect you. Pray for world peace, a war is brewing where Russia, China and the United States will be involved.

You will soon see my Son, to reunite all of you in the one love that God knows. Unfortunately, you will be persecuted and then glorified, but I am with you as a mother and as the Queen of heaven. Don't worry if you see signs in the sky, it is only my Son who is preparing his coming! Pride and arrogance are the things that are ruining the world. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Our Lady blessed those present, one by one."
"Beloved daughter, your tribulation will continue, my Son was accused of being a heretic but he continued to preach without stopping. You must go on without fear, you must always give your testimony with strength and courage, I will protect you. Welcome lukewarm souls and help them to love my Son and to approach prayer.

Now I give you my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for listening to my call. Thank you for coming here to this blessed place with so much faith.

Beloved little ones, be converted because the return of my Son is imminent and I would like you all to be ready for that moment. Have faith, this will save you. I always love you and bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. The Holy Virgin also asks to pray for the Pope and for all the Priests. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call. Pray for the Church, because the devil has already taken hold, but I will protect it with my mantle, so that my beloved children can be saved. Be converted, pray the rosary and forgive your enemies. My dear children, do not be afraid of my messages, I have been sent by God to save you and to warn you about what will happen, but I also give you the instructions not to fall into temptation, above all be attentive to worldliness, be humble and simple and be merciful. Soon the sun will show great signs. Now I give you my blessings in the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Know that your prayers are needed by many souls and many souls will be saved thanks to you. Now I pass among you to give you my blessing. Your Jesus."
"Dear daughter, I know that the tribulations are not few, but remember that I am here with you. The beloved children (priests) say that by praying to me Jesus is obscured, so little by little they want to erase me from the hearts of my children. The Church, today more than ever, needs humble and courageous priests, my great pain is to see them on the side of Satan with pride and power. Unfortunately, this will be the cause of the perdition of many souls. The war with chemical weapons is making its way, the earthquakes will continue unabated, but do not fear beloved children, I will always protect you. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer. I am very saddened because I know what awaits you. Pray, pray, pray above all for the Church which will be affected by one of the greatest battles between good and evil that have ever been seen. Soon, from the sky you will see the sun giving off fireballs, the fire of purification. Dear children, bear witness to your faith with courage and never back down. Devout daughter, offer your suffering for this sick humanity, offer your yes for all sinners. Now may my holy blessing descend upon you and sacred objects in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "
"Dear children, despite my sad heart, tonight it makes me happy to see you gathered here in prayer, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved, my sadness is caused by the sinful expression of the Church, that great torment that you feel, I feel it, the split is getting bigger and stronger. I wish to see priests, bishops and cardinals united in the one truth, the teachings of my Son Jesus and be shepherds of this flock that is being lost and do not think about your career because it will not help when you find yourself before God. My children, you will be persecuted but you cling to my rosary and you will be saved. Pray for Spain, it will have great pains. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved daughter, welcome your sufferings with joy because the love of God is a great witness for the unbelievers and the doubters. Dear daughter, embrace the Holy Church that leads to light, while the false church will lead to darkness, be careful. My Holy blessing be upon you, your family and your friends in the Name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being gathered here and for having listened to my call in your heart. I ask you once again to change your life, be humble and courageous, do not be caught unprepared when my Son arrives because he will not only come to free you from evil and to embrace you but also to judge you one by one. I, your mother, am coming and I will dry all your tears because you are my children and I want to see you joyful, pray, pray, pray and let yourself be filled with grace. The antichrist has already made his entrance into the great palace. Pray for Europe and the United States because nuclear weapons are ready for the great war. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved and devoted children, everything is ready for the arrival of my Son and I would like everyone to be equally ready to receive him. Open your hearts to mercy and often approach the Holy Eucharist, because only in this way will you be able to feel that fire of love with which my Son surrounds you. Always hold the Holy Rosary in your hands as a strong weapon to ward off evil. The false church will not stop, it will give sensational news, reaching the apex of spiritual confusion. The Holy Spirit will teach you the discernment between evil and good, between right and error. Be cautious, just and courageous. Beloved children, pray for Russia and France where the earth will tremble, pray for the United States. I am saddened by the failure to consecrate Russia to my immaculate heart, as per my request in Fatima and this will cause serious tribulations. Adored children, I love you with all my heart, may the Holy blessing descend on you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, you who are gathered here, do not imagine how happy you make me. Your prayers comfort my heart. Thank you for having responded to my call. Beloved children, be always united in prayer also in your families, always have the courage to bear witness to the faith and the graces that come to you from heaven. This is a time of tribulation where evil believes it has won, but my spotless heart will triumph very soon. Pray for my Son's Church. Soon there will come a man sent by the Father to free you from this abomination. You continue to pray for all the children chosen by the Holy Spirit. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, I thank you for being gathered here. Don't worry and don't be restless during big changes. Rejoice, you will soon embrace my Son. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, my sadness is caused by what they are doing to my Son. They continue to scourge him, to humiliate him and above all the consecrated ones chosen one by one by Jesus, have decided to replace all that are the divine laws. Dear children, pray, pray, pray! Soon the sky will thunder with the arrival of my Son. The angels will sound the last trumpets and everything will be ready. Be found in peace and love, I am here to save you. My messages will continue to be instructions for your salvation, do not be afraid of what I tell you. For too long I have been asking you for true conversion, but sometimes you turn away not believing my words. My beloved children, strengthen your prayer group. Jesus sends you his blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved daughter, how many sufferings due to those who are far from God and profess themselves prophets, unfortunately Satan puts doubts, jealousies and the worst atrocities so that you distance yourself from God, you continue your path that leads to truth and peace, I will accompany you on this path. . . entrusted. Beloved children, close your ears when you listen to Christian theologians who interpret the sacred scriptures in their own way, be always in communion with the One who represents the way, the truth and the life. Love each other and be charitable to your brothers. Pray for Spain and Poland, now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. On this occasion, Our Lady asks us to recite the Holy Rosary on the place you have chosen on Holy Thursday (13.04)."
"Beloved children, thank you for being gathered here, I feel with so much sadness in my heart how much falsehood and with how much hypocrisy the Holy Rosary is recited. Prayer is not a distracted chant, but a sweet music that comes from the heart. Dear children, stop and reflect on what is happening in the world, because you persist in not believing the messages I leave you, yet the warning is before your eyes. Soon, you will see a big cross that will be visible all over the world and this will be the last chance you will have to choose, convert, you have no more time. Now, I give you my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for being here in communion with me and I thank the new arrivals who have responded to my call. I desire that you continually nourish yourselves on the body of my Son, immersing yourselves in his cup. Join in prayer, follow my messages, God allows me to still be here with you to give you peace and his love for him. My apostles, trust in Jesus, give yourselves completely to God. He is the light, the hope and the love. Ask God and he will answer you, talk to Jesus, carry his cross with love. Soon, very soon the earth will be purified, but my beloved will not have to fear. Trust and you will be saved. Prepare the blessed candles and keep them ready. Dear children, know that God's love for you is immense! But how limited is your love for him! When He knocks on your hearts, what do you do? Don't be blind and don't be deaf. Reflect, follow the Gospel and always hold the rosary in your hands. Pray, pray, pray! I will give many graces to you, welcome them and bear witness to them with faith. Know that I love you. May my holy blessing descend on you and in particular on the children present, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, pray a lot to support the cross of my Son which is very heavy. Still today he suffers greatly from the mistakes of humanity. Forgive and do not get discouraged, do not get angry because you will become weaker and in weakness Satan will creep into you. Do not retreat, be faithful to my Son and his cross, walk in truth and peace. My dear children, remember that God is love, He chose the narrow path and allowed Himself to be crucified for your love. Instead, you always seek the widest path because you do not always entrust yourself to Him. Pray for Japan and Syria, the earth everywhere will tremble stronger and stronger. I leave you with all my maternal love and bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved, my love for you is great and that is why I ask you to share my pain. I thank everyone for the work they are doing in my vineyard, especially your spouse. I thank you in seeing you gathered with fervor in prayer, but be careful, do not be tempted by my greatest enemy which is Satan. Today this modernist Church continues to make me suffer, I wish that the priests continue to wear the cassock, that they do not hand over my body in desecrated hands and that they continue to follow the true teaching of the Church. Beware of consecrated-Judas and Catholic-Judas, as they accompany souls to hell. When you hear the sky thunder and the earth tremble, I will come to embrace all my disciples to take them to new lands and new heavens, I still anticipate my coming because this earth is too contaminated. Dear brothers, I dry your tears and give you my holy blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Your Jesus."
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. What is written will happen, the earth will be purified. Earthquakes and floods will be there for all to see, many will flee but those who are faithful to my Son will not have to fear. My children, pray, pray, pray, the day of my Son's coming is already set, we are at the end of time and the angels are ready for this battle against evil. Heaven loves you and I love you. These are times where tribulations will be stronger and stronger but you will have my protection. Now I give you my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, continue to kneel in prayer and please do not weaken. Satan is taking so many of my children. When you are in suffering, don't think about solving everything by yourself, it's a big mistake! Remember, when you are in trial and fall, stand up again, demonstrating the trust you have in Jesus. In this period of Lent be in peace, do not have lukewarm faith and do not pray out of inertia. Beware of science, beware of vaccines, they will try to manipulate everyone from birth. Beware of fake democracies because you will soon find yourself immersed in the dictatorship. My dear children, how much I love you and how much I want to protect you. Listen to my messages! I would very much like to carry you all safely in the arms of my Son. Soon a meteorite will arrive on earth. Look often at the sky and its signs. Now I give you my holy blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call. It makes me happy to see in this blessed place so many of my favorite children and above all so many people of faith who listen to my messages and who follow my advice. Beloved children, open your heart to my Son, love as he loves you, love is the greatest weapon to fight evil. Never break down before your cross, as I embraced that of my Son who died for love and defeated death. Let us pray together for the Church and for the priests who follow the Gospel and the Sacred Scriptures and who at times have to be recollected to hear what Jesus wants from them. Unfortunately, many of them are confused, but I ask them to go forward with courage. I love you my children, if you only knew how great love is for you! Let your tears dry from your heavenly mother. Pray for Russia. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Our Lady opened her arms as if to embrace us and protect us under her mantle. "
"Beloved children, the heavens and the earth will tremble but you will be saved by your faith. I insist on asking for the conversion of many, get converted and love! This is the time of reconciliation and love. Forgive your brothers, do not live like the Pharisees, Jesus will judge you for how much love you have given. Pray for Chile where suffering will abound. Now I give you my holy blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. I, your mother, am here this evening, to call you one by one as apostles and to gather all my people to tell you that everything is being fulfilled. Look around you, you will be taken in the arms of my Son during your sleep and brought to the new earth where you will be able to satiate yourself with the wonders I have prepared for you. Announce his arrival to everyone, be pure and joyful. Confess and eat as much as you can of the body of my Son. Do not delay in converting, there is no more time. Pray for Spain, the earth will tremble strongly. Pray for Rome. My beloved, I leave you with the blessing of the Holy Trinity, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, I cry for a Son who still today as before continues to be insulted, mortified and crucified. Be faithful to him and remember that he died for the great love for humanity, but when he returns, those who believe in him will have eternal life. I cry for what awaits you. Eucharist prayer and fasting must be your food these days. Pray, pray, pray, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, you make my heart glad to see you gathered here as I have requested. Beloved children, rejoice in this Easter because Jesus my Son died for the remission of sins of past humanity and that of these times, thus giving you eternal life, which is not only of the spirit, but also of the soul and of the physical. Dear children, after the crucifixion my Son spent five hours on the cross before expiring. He did the Father's will for all of you, even though they spit and insulted him, but this was the greatest gesture of love he could do for us. So please, since his greatest gift than him is to be alive in the Eucharist, feed on him always, repent and get ready. His arrival is near! Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Our Lady was dressed in white and next to her was Jesus. Our Lady embraced us all. This Rosary, recited on the mountain on Holy Thursday, was expressly requested by Our Lady, to celebrate the institution of the Eucharist and the Priesthood. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call, tonight I ask you to rejoice because my Son is risen and so, I would like you too to rise again with him. Come out of your graves, from that of selfishness, slander, wickedness, blasphemy, pain caused by yourself, resurrect from all this and you will be saved. My little ones, always remember to love each other as brothers to always preach love and peace. In these times you will have to pray a lot for all that you go through. Make circles of prayer, I will always be with you to protect you. Pray for France. Now, I give you my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Oh! my beloved children, thank you for being here, in this blessed house, thank you for being many to open your heart to my Son and you are still many in the world, do not be afraid of what happens around you, I am and will always be at your side. My great joy is to see one of my favorite children whom I always call in humility united with you. Obey the Church as long as everything is in the gospel and in the holy scriptures. Preach love, pray for Rome. I love you and with maternal love I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for those who have listened to my call. Dear children, the time available has come to an end, sometimes you are so used to evil that you do not see the demons that surround you, you cannot see the antichrist who is already among you. Remember that good begets good and evil begets evil. Embrace your cross and carry it with joy and love and you will be victorious, just as Jesus conquered death. My beloved, be my apostles and always bear witness to your faith with courage so that many souls can be saved. Pray for Russia and for the Pope much depends on him. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved daughter, nature is rebelling, men are heading for self-destruction. Dear daughter, you spread this message to priests, bishops and cardinals. I ask you to confess the sins of heresy and the carnal sins because they are very serious! Confess before it is too late, entrust yourselves to the mercy of Jesus. Beloved children, I intercede for you, but you live my messages and always be humble, as I have taught you. Pray for the United States. I love you and bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for having listened to my call in your heart, I know how much you are suffering for everything that surrounds you, for the wars that are starting, for all the victims and for so much suffering in the world. I also suffer with you, but if they had listened to my words all this would have been avoided, I had asked to consecrate some nations to my immaculate heart, but they did not listen to me. My beloved, you who are experiencing my grace, my great love and the immense mercy of Jesus, bear witness without fear and with courage and above all continue to live my messages, my presence among you serves to save souls and always intercede for you. I love you immensely, woe to those who with their pride lead souls towards perdition and confusion, because they will suffer the righteousness of God. Now I bless you and the sacred objects you carry, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, now the time to return to pray in homes is about to begin. My heart is saddened when I see the powerful of the world, the consecrated and many of my children in the hands ofSatan, but you will soon be in the time of warning and choice. I ask you to choose love for my Son, save yourselves and get converted, I will always be at your side with all maternal love. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for listening to my call in your heart. I know and know your sufferings and your tribulations, but I am here to dry your tears and always be close to you. Unfortunately, at this moment Satan is taking as many souls as possible. If man had listened to my words and Fatima messages more, you would not be at this point. I pray all of you to live humility and silence, this is my legacy. I love you my apostles. Always kneel in prayer. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Today Our Lady was dressed in white and had a blue mantle. She extended her arms as a sign of protection for all present and for all those for whom we have prayed. She is thinking of everyone. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being here. What do I still have to do to make my Son Jesus love? Ask for graces, but don't pray with an open heart. Love each other as brothers. Beware of consecrated persons who do not follow the gospel, whose guidance leads to the abyss, whoever follows them will meet the darkness. I love you so much my children and I put you on guard for your salvation. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "
"Dear children, thank you for all those who have heard my call in their hearts for this special apparition. Today are 100 years of my appearances and announcements. My beloved, the consecration to my immaculate heart is an immense protection against the diseases that will soon occur and against the attacks of the demons. After so many apparitions, many still do not believe my messages, but these are the times when everything will be seen with your eyes. Love and defend the Holy Trinity, proclaim love in the world and you will see graces and wonders descend upon you. Thank you, my little ones, I love you, now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear daughter, my heart aches for the blasphemous and false men who preach love, but do not carry it out, for their pride and their arrogance. Beloved of heaven, keep my people united and you will soon enjoy the wonders ready for you. You are blessed by the Holy Trinity in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being gathered here in this blessed place. People of God loved by me and by the Most Holy Trinity, to reunite you is what I would like for all humanity. I have chosen you to be an example today and always, just as I have gathered you today, I will gather you again to save you and all the souls who still do not find the peace, the truth and the way. Love each other as brothers. The graces requested by you and my blessing will descend on you, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, AmenToday's sign: 'My People'. Signs from Heaven 'IHS'."
"Dear children, God's arm can no longer be stopped. The fire of purification will soon arrive on the earth tainted by evil. The time has come. The corruption of men has no more time. My beloved, convert and pray, pray a lot, soon the church will no longer be my Son's house. Today most of my consecrated children no longer behave like pastors and this is my greatest pain. I ask you to love my Jesus and to keep the Sacred Scriptures. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. My holy blessing descends on your families and on the sacred objects that you carry with you. Pray for France. From the moment the Eucharist is removed from the Church, Jesus sacramentally will no longer dwell in it. "
"Dear brothers, I draw ever closer to you in this time of grace, every day you will see and feel my presence to give you a taste of my love for you. I love you so much that I died for your salvation. My beloved, you will soon enjoy the delights I have prepared for you. Listen to what my beloved Mother tells you. Thank you, brothers for gathering here. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being gathered here. I ask you to adorn a small altar in your homes, I ask you to pray the Holy Rosary every day by lighting a blessed candle. Get ready because these are the times. My beloved and precious children, how much grace will descend on your hearts! Always love my Son, just as I love you. All that was foretold will happen, even if it has been mitigated by prayer. I am here with you. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My delightful jewels, thank you for having accepted my call, do not be troubled by what is happening around you, soon believers and non-believers will see the great miracle, a great light will appear all over the earth, the skies will thunder, no one will say anything except praise God for his power and greatness. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for listening to my call in your heart. I am here among you because I strongly feel the grace of your prayer. My children, your Jesus will soon be among you, he is already on your heads to infuse you with the Holy Spirit, peace in your hearts and union among you brothers. Always love my son. Unfortunately, Satan works in your minds putting doubts and fears. Pray for the priests, bishops and cardinals who are at this moment against each other and are not always led by the Holy Spirit. Pray for the Church, it will soon be freed from this confusion. I love you and I always protect you, call me and I will always be there with you. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved daughter, Satan is putting his tentacles into prayer groups and all that is Sacred to create misunderstandings, tares, false doctrines, doubts and bitterness. It helps to understand how great is the merciful and just love of Jesus. Charity, love and unity make the people of God. My daughter, worse times will come but be jealously tied to the truth and to the sacred scriptures of the past. Listen and spread this appeal, I will stand by each of you so that you may be worthy of the new earth. I bless you with maternal love in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dearest and beloved daughter of the Most Holy Trinity, do not burden your heart with the things of the world, because you are in the world but you are not of the world. She loves everyone as much as I love you.

Not a childish, emotional and occasional faith, but an adult and conscious faith.

Let us pray for the conversion of hearts because he wants his children to be safe from him!

My beloved, soon my Son will return once more, to free you from your sins. What are you still waiting for to convert, do you still want signs?

My dear brothers, never be afraid to divulge the messages given from heaven, they serve to prepare you for everything that will soon happen. I will no longer be present in the Church, get ready to gather in homes to pray, as my mother had predicted you.

Now, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, I ask you to always discern, to understand who says to speak in my name, there are many who will come forward saying that they are sent by the Father, but they will not be beings of light, but beings of darkness.

Now, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear daughter, you must tell everyone to look at what is happening in the world, everything is now in ruins, floods, landslides, torrential rains, hail, what I said is happening. My beloved, when I ask to be converted quickly, I mean NOW, humanity cannot afford to waste any more time in futile things while it has reached true purification, even the economy of the various countries will be heavily destroyed. My little one, be strong, do not be afraid to tell the truth, only so many will understand. The time that separates you from the Savior is short, now the sky and the earth are united, only by returning to God can there be salvation.

My beloved, pray for America because soon something great will invest this nation dear to me and will involve the whole world, so I ask you not to waste time, conversion is important to prepare for the encounter with Jesus, do it now because you have only known God's love and mercy, but you hope to never see his justice.

Never stray from the love of God and from his word, open your hearts and He will enter like a storm of love and you will understand that nothing is without God, you will have to do everything to bring your brothers to Him and have the certainty of eternal life. Now I bless you, the sick present and the sacred objects you wear, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, pray for my Holy Church, they want to modernize what God has left written. Children, the will of men at this moment is not the will of God. Dear my little ones, you are my army, be light for all brothers, so that they can open their hearts.

My dear children, always nourish yourselves on the Word and on what Jesus has left, whoever claims to change it offends God, his Word is immutable and will be forever. My children, I speak to my priests, I want them to understand and realize what God has done for them, making them similar to Jesus, giving them the possibility to forgive sins in His Name, to take bread and wine in their hands and in the moment of consecration, transform them into the true body and true blood of my Son, therefore my children, do not dirty your hands with sins, avoid pride and arrogance, but be humble.

"My children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Why don't I see many of my children? What are they distracted from! My beloved children, you marvel when I say that incomprehensible things will happen, remember that all that I have predicted will happen at this time, therefore, I ask you to prepare yourselves for the events that will arrive, prepare yourselves with prayer and sacrifices, do not fear, because angels who are on earth will protect you, they are many sent from heaven.

My children, I ask families to teach their children love, peace and mercy, these young people grow up without God, why don't you decide to let him enter families? Everything would always be love only. This is the time where there will be apostles of God and apostles of Satan, especially within the church there will be Bishops against Bishops, priests against priests, parents against children, husbands against wives and so on, this is the time of persecution, soon everything will be clarified. The warning is upon you, I love you and call on me, and I will be with you. Now, I give you my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer. When I look at you, while you help each other as brothers, my Immaculate heart fills with joy. Children, my apparitions are not accepted, neither by a part of the Church, nor by many of my favorite children, they do not seriously believe that the Trinity has given humanity a great opportunity, allowing me, Co-redemptrix, to warn its children, so that they return to God. God is good and merciful, but do not waste time, if you ask Jesus for forgiveness with your heart, He will take you by the hand, convert you children and be ready for the Warning, it will be an important spiritual event for each of you. Seek strength in the Rosary, in the Eucharist and in Confession, be ready and live each day as if it were your last. Now, I bless you, your families and your hearts in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having listened to my call in your heart. My beloved, what was foretold is coming, the Church is now in the most total division, the followers of Jesus, against the followers of Satan. Children, terrible times are about to arrive, the earth will tremble, just like it has never happened before. Have faith in God, because only in this way will you go where everything will be peace and infinite love, while on earth the death of sinners will be infinite. All of you are the Lord's, do not fear, woe to the haughty and proud man, because he will feel all the punishment of God. Pray for Italy and for Europe. Now, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Hello, love and peace in this house. I, God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, am here among you. I ask you children, why do you not love me, I am your Father, the only true Father, I love you with a disproportionate love. Children, how much joy I had in creating everything, why do you avoid me? To make you understand how great the love I feel for my children is, I sent my only Son for you, to give you the concreteness of my being here with you. To redeem you from your sins he went up on the cross and died for you, as I could if I had not been a good and merciful Father. Don't be afraid of me. I say to families, teach your children to see me as the good Father who comes down among you to love you. Tell me your confidences, I have never pushed anyone away, I am not bad, I am not that old man who is painted, I am not, neither old nor young, I am the Eternal Father, good and merciful. Oh children! What a grace to be here with you, I wanted to gather you here, in this house that now belongs to me, as in all houses where prayer is in force. My children, I still remind you, do not be afraid of me. I say to the priests present and not present, please, teach the commandments, teach what I have left you, make sure that people are not afraid of me, I am the good, merciful and living Father. The Cross and the Eucharist is what you must see, the cross is the remission for your sins and it is the only thing that unites you to reach me, the Eucharist, requested and founded by my Son, is the gift of a wonderful grace that you can all enjoy. I, Father Almighty Creator of all, ask my creatures to love me, I have never asked for anything, only Love, and where Love is in force I am there, you are my family and I want you all together to proclaim in one voice only one thing, Love, the Love of God, the Love that comes from me, that passes through my Son, the Love through my chosen Mary Most Holy Virgin Immaculate. Now, I bless you in the name of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer together, as true Apostles. Children, I have gathered you here so that you can see and pray for my tears and for my heart torn with pain. Soon, the punishment will come upon the church, punishment that cannot be postponed, so that sin can be destroyed, too much arrogance and pride have ruined my beloved children. The Lord does not want theologians, but shepherds who welcome souls with love and tenderness, loving them and guiding them towards the light and not letting them descend into darkness with them. Children, pray a lot so that the punishment can be mitigated. Pray for America. Now, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for listening to my call in our hearts. My children, always keep the flame of faith burning and I beg you, pray, pray, pray, because the times are ripe.

Don't fall asleep like the apostles did. I am here to guide you. I love you and I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Handmaid of the Lord, disclose what I tell you: the true Church faithful to Jesus Christ is under the rubble of the same Church, if my children do not arm themselves with prayer and humility, suffering will soon see many of my favorite children fall. They are changing the Holy Gospel and changing the prayers. this is not love for Jesus, but believing that you can create your own doctrine, putting yourself in God's place. My dear children, you will have nothing to fear, because before the purification, which is about to arrive on earth, you will be protected and brought into safe places, where the evil one will not be able to touch you. Pray, pray, pray. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Beloved children, I still touch the earth with the hope that there are still many conversions, listen to my messages which are given only for the love of humanity. The church is in grave danger, I want to say, to my beloved children, have courage, nourish yourselves with the Holy Gospel, remember that where there is pride there is no God and where there is pride there is no faith, have love for your brothers and be always united in the love of Jesus. Tomorrow, I will still be with you my Apostles. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having responded to my call in your heart. Children, how much comfort I feel in my heart wounded by the abomination of this world. Sweet creatures, I ask you to let yourselves handle your heart, like a clay vessel so as to shape it to the great love of Jesus. Dear children, be apostles of light, be serene for those who do not believe in my real presence, in this place blessed by the Father, because my presence and my instructions, for your salvation, will thunder from one end of the world to the other, so that my people can reunite to love Jesus and make you find ready for the days to come. Be my apostles, be solid walls and fortresses for lukewarm souls. Now, I leave you with my Holy Blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having listened to my call in your heart. Beloved children, so many ask for the signs of the arrival of my Son Jesus, sin will no longer be believed when Protestantization takes place in the church, those will be the signs that will indicate his coming to you. My children, this is the moment when demons come to life more than ever on earth, the devil's project is at its highest fulfilment, do not be attracted by the glitter of the world, I am here to protect you, I love you with all my heart. Now, I leave you with my maternal blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, do not be afraid for what will happen, continue in prayer, penance and sacrifices in this Easter period. My beloved, the Lord Jesus Christ as my sweet Son continues to be persecuted, especially by men of the Church, woe, 10 times woe, for those who are at the top of the Church, I speak to the Bishops and Cardinals who take advantage of obedience sacrosanct to persecute the holy priests and faithful to the Gospel and who fight for the Truth and the word of God, for this, the justice of God will be 10 times worse. What has been written will come true, love each other as brothers. Pray for Russia and France. Now, I leave you my holy blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, how much comfort I feel in my heart in seeing you here in prayer, this is my Church, I know all your afflictions, but I ask you to entrust yourselves to my Jesus, so that I can bestow many graces for all of you, today there will be some healings. Dear children, stay close to God with all your heart, the times that will come will be hard. Why do so many of my children decide to be on the side of evil? Whoever has faith and looks at the laws of God need not fear anything. My darlings, have mercy on those who are wrong, love them. Be close to the Gospel and the Word, above all love as God loves you and forgive as He forgives, so that the kingdom of heaven can open up to enjoy what is ready for you. Now, I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, I, the Son of the Father, I ask you in this period of Lent, make sacrifices for me. Oh! how many times have I gone to my consecrated to ask, where are the souls you are bringing to me, yet there are none, how many chosen children have I passed by to ask for the same thing and how many souls have I found that have approached my heart and in my Mom's. This is why I choose on the basis of the open hearts that have the hearts of children and the souls turned to heaven and not those who drink the cup of worldliness and that of earthly pleasures. Brothers, I want you to be one soul with mine. My chosen daughter and sister, thank you for your peace, despite everything, I know your suffering, but I know that you are offering me everything, that's why I love you, how much love I feel in your heart for me, but tell me how much do you love me? How much do you want to suffer for me? This is what I want. Your brothers and your beloved husband are lights and honey for me for my sufferings. I love you all and would love to show you how special you are to heaven. I bless you, your Dear Jesus. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Dear children, in this Easter period continue with penances and sacrifices. Children, ask to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit together with the seven gifts, invoke him and he will descend on you. My children, the times that are coming will be very hard to face, strengthen your faith and make an examination of conscience, when you go to Church to attend Holy Mass, you think you have washed your conscience, but this is not the way to be in peace with God, you must live it intensely and not simply assist in it, you need confession and communion with others too. Make circles of prayer. The earth will tremble again, the Vatican will be shaken, pray for America which will be tormented by nature. I bless you, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear blessed children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer, ease the pains of my Son Jesus. My beloved, conversion is what I continually ask for in the places where I have appeared and where I continue to appear, only in this way will you be able to enter the kingdom of skies. My Son wants you all to be saved, sinners and non-sinners, remember that God loves everyone in the same way, he awaits his children with love, patience and mercy. Now, I leave you with my maternal blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Beloved children, my little flock, be filled with the Holy Spirit, I pray for each one of you before God, so that the fire of the Holy Spirit may set your soul, your spirit on fire. My beloved, please be strong in the faith and above all in the true and unique Christian doctrine, in this period many things will be denied to you by my beloved children, but do not bow down before the modernist changes and praises, because they do not come from God. Now, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved, here is the war is near, pray a lot with the Holy Rosary in your hands, only with the true Faith can something change. My children, because my Son Jesus continues to be mortified, he died to redeem you from sins, do not be each God of yourselves, remember that the facilitated paths come from Satan, but those of God are reached only with suffering. Children, do not be dazzled by the false lights, love my Son and the cross, only in this way can you be worthy of his Love and of his Peace. Now, I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Dear children, now we are in the time when the heavens will open and you will hear the trumpets of the Angels sound, the purification will be stronger than before. My beloved children, the Eucharist will soon be removed from the Church. Pray, pray, pray for the rulers of America, that they don't make bad decisions. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Beloved children, in this Easter week, love the Cross and thank the Lord, you will not always be able to understand all that God's plans are and it is often humanly incomprehensible, only heaven and prayer will be able to answer your questions if you have opened your heart. Do not change the prayers and do not change anything of the dogmas of the faith because it would be a blasphemy, Satan is cunning, he takes souls without you noticing. I love you, I am your Mother, I protect you and I place you all under my Mantle. Now, I leave you with my maternal blessing, the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."

I created this family, so that you can unite in front of my mystical body, do not abandon me, look at the signs of the times and do not be afraid, I am with you and I will be beside you. Also tell the blasphemers, the most hardened sinners to ask me for forgiveness and forgiveness will be granted to them. Beloved children, if you knew how much I love you! As children and as brothers I ask you not to leave me alone in this moment of suffering, they stripped me, mocked and humiliated me, and so it will also happen to you in my name, you will be humiliated and stripped, but how great will the Kingdom of heaven be that you I promised! I love you brothers and I bless you one by one, your brother Jesus. Thank you for welcoming me into this house once again. "

Humanity, on the other hand, turns to the other side not believing, indeed despising this Grace. Yet she is my Mother and yours, who cares for her children and weeps for lost humanity. Do not despise Grace, stay in silence and prayer. I am with you, love me and I will lead you where everything is ready. Now I bless you in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for listening to my call in your heart. Pray, pray, pray for peace and for what awaits you.

Pray for the Church, because the fighters are coming and the attack will be disastrous, don't let yourselves be plagued by wolves in sheep's clothing, everything will soon take a big turn. Look at the sky, you will see the signs of the end times. I will be with you until the end of the prayer. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"I, Almighty Father, but don't see wars! Why don't you understand? Pray my children, my Son he loves you! I sent him for your salvation and you turn away, love my Son, he is your only salvation as it once was and will be today. Oh! My beloved Mary, born without original sin, put to work for you, and you, oh! you, humanity lost by sin. Humanism entered the Church by making believe that man is master of the world, my world has become the world of Satan, everything is in confusion. What are you doing to your children! What are you leaving to your children, without any respect, without any sacredness, without faith, teach Love and great will be the reward in the Kingdom of Heaven. I love you children, I love you! I will always protect you, be steadfast in the faith and I will protect you. I your merciful Father, I ask you, have mercy on my Son, do not fall into sin. I love and bless you all and I will be with you every minute of your life, Amen. "
"My dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Beloved children, I would like to instruct you what to ask for and how to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ; Children, open your hearts in prayer. Ask God to be immersed in his light, so that you can bear witness with courage and speak of Jesus without fear: ask for the gift of knowledge, humility and brotherhood. When all this happens, your Yes will be sincere: you will have everything you need, the graces will descend on you and you will feel joy and peace in your heart. Go to mass because He is waiting for you. Scream to the world that my Son will soon be with you. May the blessing of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit descend upon you and your families, Amen. "

Children, times are very hard, but I am here and I will not leave you alone, but only if you really want it. Children, pray for the Church, the world is lost in the clutches of Satan, but our prayer and the Rosary will be a great protection for you and for your families. Pastors, evangelize, bring the word of God into homes, teach young people about love, this is the Church, the family, the first little church, do not be afraid of being judged, but go ahead with God's blessing. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, I will be with you until the end of the prayer to bless you and the sacred objects you wear, today children many graces will come down, Amen.

"My beloved children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer with faith. At this moment all we need is prayer, where are my children! Great is my suffering, because my Son Jesus has been set aside, our merciful God is about to be replaced, how many tears have I shed!, even of blood, to make you understand my pain and despair, because faith is little in this land! Children, bring my messages into the world, gather souls to bring to Jesus, do not be silent, but warriors of Light, tell the world to convert and to love only our God, One and Triune.

My children, I invite you to the love that has always united you and to prayer, do you remember my messages? Have you lived them completely? Do not forget that the devil is very strong in these times, he tempts you and forces you to disunion, he creates doubts about everything, above all by overturning the truth. I love you, I am your Mother, who came down from heaven to protect you, live the grace that God has allowed to send you and always be courageous witnesses. Children, I am here, do not be afraid, together with my Son we will always protect you, do not allow the great confusion generated in these times to enter your lives, but be faithful to the Word, the Gospel. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, how great is the pain and suffering that I feel every time my chosen ones are derided, judged and looked at as plague, everything is taking place. My son is about to be put out of the church, those who do this continue to make Jesus' wounds bleed even more and do not believe that justice will soon befall them. Here is the word of God will be fulfilled. My children, remember that the Word and the Gospel are immutable. After the great pain my Church will rise again with few faithful, but true ones. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My brothers, I am here with you, how small you are, you are still children, I want you great in faith with your hearts as children. Oh! My brothers, I ask you not to waver with faith, or you will make room for Satan.

My children, my brothers, how much I love you., My angels protect you from the attacks of the earth, be calm and trust me, I will never leave you alone, I know your hearts and I know how great your love is for me, for my Mother and my Father. Be anchored in faith, it is your only salvation together with prayer. Dear brothers, I love you and I am with you today and always. Now, I bless you all, in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My daughter, thank you for your prayers, do not be agitated by the things of the world, but continue in prayer. Scream to the world that whoever is faithful to God will soon feel joy, carefree, love, but whoever turns the other way adoring gods or other, they will feel their hearts darken and feel despair, despair and sadness. The return of the Son of God is near, rejoice and announce the new Jerusalem. My daughter, how much pain I feel for not having fulfilled my request for consecration, remind those who do not want to listen to me, that faith is also courage and witness, God spits out the lukewarm.

"My beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, how much peace I feel in your hearts despite the sad moments, but please, strengthen your faith and prayer, I ask for circles of prayer in your homes.

Children, so many will be the Graces that will descend for those who have faith, my Immaculate Heart will soon Triumph. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

My daughter, the persecution of Christians will begin shortly, so be very careful, take my advice from Mother and do not turn away. Have patience, love and mercy for your brothers because dark moments will come when you will not find yourselves. America will suffer the greatest pain due to the laws against God. Always be faithful to the true magisterium of the Church, God is the only one you must rely on, stay away from false modernist ideologies, otherwise you will be blind leading other blind people. I love you and with Maternal Love I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for being here in prayer, oh! how much you lighten my pain and that of my Son! My beloved, but what humanity is doing, it is welcoming, exalting and proclaiming sin as something pleasing to God, but it is not so, for these the gates of hell will open. My children, come often to visit me in this place blessed by the Father. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, how much joy I feel in seeing so many shepherds in this blessed place and how many children I see full of faith who pray, being close to my Son Jesus, who especially in these times, a spear still pierces his heart. Beloved children, St. Joseph is also here, and he is with me to pray over you. My beloved, invoke the Holy Spirit so that you may be enlightened in spirit and heart. Children, do not be afraid, I am with you, the devil cannot hurt anyone who is faithful to God. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My daughter, how great and heavy is the mission entrusted by heaven, but I will help you and I will always be beside you. There is only one truth, Love for God, which is the center of everything, but not everyone opens their hearts and lets themselves be invaded by the flame of the Holy fire. Please children, do not let the flame go out. How many children of mine are harassed by Satan who works in the minds with negative thoughts against the brothers, thoughts of persecution and enmity, but only the light of the Spirit can enlighten you, giving you peace. Soon a great light a will appear in the sky and God will thunder in all his glory. Now I bless you, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

My beloved, I am beside you and I bless you one by one, so that the Holy Spirit may open your hearts in a total way.

My children, many will be the souls that I will take with me, because they are good and with us, they will find peace, but I will make unassailable those who are strong in faith and following the Gospel will serve God with their testimony and their strength in the Truth. Beloved children, when Jesus was crucified by giving his life for you, the high priests asked for a sign, but he refused and it was not believed. After two thousand years, some priests still ask for signs today, but they do not understand that the Lord acts only in open hearts. Pray and Forgive. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My brothers, thank you for being here in prayer, I am with you, open your hearts and let my light enter, so that you can look at everything differently with the eyes of the spirit and no longer with those of reason. Too much reasoning takes you away from me and between you brothers. My beloved, be faithful to God at all hours of the day, so that when I arrive you can enter the new land, where joy and love will be the only good you will find. Brothers, your whole life should be founded on Love. I was born for Love and died for Love, but in this humanity, it seems that Love is no longer part of it, yet you often say you love me! but why, instead, do I see only feelings of pride, envy and jealousy? Remember that God will judge for how much Love you have given. Now I bless you in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved, because of dullness you do not see what is happening in the world, because you do not believe what you touch with your hand, but I tell you my children, the Wrath of God is already upon you to make you understand that He is also right. Beloved children, draw near to God, begin to love Jesus, do not be afraid, with Him beside you, you will be better. These are also times of Grace, pray with a pure heart and you will see wonders. I bless you, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, your Jesus is here with you, feel comforted by my Love, how many of my children will be hated starting from the hierarchies of the Church, will hate you in my name, the injustice will be great. Children, how many theologians! Oh! what pain I feel in my heart, it is terrible, theology closes everyone's hearts, they did not understand my love for you and they did not understand your love for me. Children, brothers, you have not yet seen anything of what will happen, love my cross of love, but also the bitter one, I will be beside you, there will be nothing greater than me in your lives, I will be with you to protect you, no one will be able to touch you, not even with a finger and no hair will be removed from these beloved children of mine. What a little faith I see in those who enter the Churches, they say they pray, but then blinded by hatred, pride, selfishness, they rail on my favorite children. Oh! dear children, your pain is my pain, your crying is my crying, but your victory will be my victory with you, now and forever, Amen. Truly I say to you, Rejoice, for yours will be the kingdom of heaven. Now I bless you and touch you one by one, in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved children, I beg you, live your Priesthood with me with courage, do not be proud to the point of letting souls go towards darkness, confusion and ignorance. Children, you first must be the light for humanity, do not change anything of the Gospel, of the word of God and of the Holy Mass where my Son Jesus is alive, woe to those who leave souls towards perdition because the responsibility will be yours. Dear children, when you ask Jesus to return, know that He is already in you, let him be born in your heart. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved children, soon my Jesus will return, but how much faith he will find! I see, even more today, how many workers of the Lord turn away from my Immaculate Heart, because of the words of blasphemers, blasphemers and heretics. Children, pray for America because due to the changes, it will make many nations cry. The Church will suffer a strong attack. Children, be faithful to the Gospel and the Word of God. Now, I touch you one by one and I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for this celebration and thank you for bringing joy to my tormented heart for these times. Children, they want to remove me from the throne ... I, Mary Immaculate, Co-redemptrix, Queen of the Angels of heaven and earth, but Satan will not prevail and your devotion will be ever greater. Continue with the recitation of the Holy Rosary.

"Beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart.

My beloved, how many lights I see on Christmas trees and in the streets, but few, in your hearts, remember children, be light for your brothers, bright lights and not the deepest darkness that reigns in your life at this moment. Now I leave you and I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved little ones, sweeten my pain with your prayer, such is the faith I feel in your hearts. My children, I would like you to look at the cave where the Son of God was born, give me your hands and I will lead you to that poor little bed, there you will learn humility, which will make you walk the road to get to God. I love you all and with my Jesus in my arms, I will pass by to bless each one of you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Your sufferings are my bitter cup, I too was afraid to drink that bitter cup and three times I asked my Father to take off this great weight, but it was not possible, I was human like you, but also spiritual, like you, you are becoming.

Beloved children, look at everything that is happening around you, the Church is in collapse, along with many of my consecrated people, earthquakes are everywhere, viruses have taken their path, the economy is collapsing, yet your Faith continues to be weak, but you really don't realize it all? You are in the midst of a whirlwind and in battle and if only you realized all of this, then you would increase your Faith, you would bend your knees in prayer. Convert children, I will be with you every time you invoke me. Now I leave you with my holy blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer. My daughter, my gaze is turned on this shocked and confused humanity, because they look at the things of the world and do not rely on my words and those of Jesus. I have warned several times for what you are experiencing, I ask my children to world, to my beloved ones to pray a lot, so that I can be close to you. Beloved children, do not be in confusion, but offer Masses and feed on the Eucharist, I repeat once again: 'CONVERT'. I await the last dogma, that of Co-redemptrix, for the salvation of humanity. Now I leave you with my Holy Blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My daughter, these are the dark moments predicted by me, when everyone mocked you, today they are afraid, do not fear children, I Co-redemptrix of the world will send my beloved children to help you, comfort you and you will lack nothing, including Jesus alive in body, blood and divinity. I know your difficulties regarding the Eucharist and to avoid that my Son Jesus is outraged, for those who will not be able to take communion in the mouth, equip yourself with a linen handkerchief and with the same bring it to your mouth without touching it with your hands, keep the handkerchief carefully and always reuse the same. I love you children, I will be beside you and bless you every day, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, thank you for having listened to my call in your heart. My children, why do you wait for terrible things to get closer to God and when everything is fine you do not know your Savior? My children, it will not be the last virus that will arrive from the earth, but wait for something else, earthquakes and pestilences, the world is full of them and many, despite everything, have already given their souls to the devil. Children, this is the time, convert, pray and believe in the Gospel, I promise you protection. Beloved children, many of you ask my Son to return soon and He will arrive, but only when He sees the abomination, sin and blasphemies spread even more and evil will no longer give you the strength to return to God, then, His arrival will be the last act of mercy. My beloved children, pray, pray a lot, I as the Mother of all of you, I will protect you and I will be beside you. Now I leave you with my Holy Blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear beloved children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloved, how many pains continue in your life! Children, in this period of Lent, offer all your pain to the Heart of Jesus who is suffering with you a lot, for the Church, for the consecrated and for you faithful children in the Gospel and in the Word of God. The evil one is taking away many souls, taking advantage of this moment of confusion, but I, as Co-redemptrix of humanity, have brought you to the foot of the Cross and ask for help from my beloved children: help me to bring many souls to God so that you too can be co-redeemers together with Me and in the end victorious with Me. My little ones, never be afraid of the truth. The Lord Jesus, remember, is Life, Truth and Way. Today many graces will descend on you. Now I give you my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Then Our Lady added: live his Passion with me and with Jesus. Today Our Lady was a little sad; she was wearing a beautiful long white dress and to her left she held a crystal rosary; her feet rested on the world and she invited me to look at images of wars and deaths. Our Lady invites us to incessant prayer. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer in this domestic church, this is my desire, to pray together in peace with the heart turned to Jesus. Children, be humble and I ask you to take the narrowest path to your holiness and not the one without difficulty, which leads to perdition, think of your soul. Pray for Germany. Do not judge the priests, because many will be judged heavily by God. I am here with you to comfort you and I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Brief Here, my sister, this is the moment when I will divide the light from the darkness. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer, I ask you to confess and cleanse your soul, go forward in the truth in this time of purification. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear brothers and my children, thank you for having listened to my call in your heart. Thank you for your love, I your King, I will soon be with you to take back what belongs to God. My children, what are they doing to me! My heart and that of my Most Holy Mother cries, I had already told you that soon I would no longer be present in my house, here is the moment of my crucifixion. Once again it is stronger than before, never have there been such bad times for me, all always by the decision of men, how foolish this humanity is! They have forgotten that I died for them. I bless you in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. You dear children, do not be afraid of viruses, but rather of being without the bread of eternal life. My beloved, be united, so that you may always be the light of the world, never turn off this light. Children, any means of praying together is useful. Children, pray for Rome because it will drink the bitter cup. Pray for Russia. Oh! Beloved children, if they had listened to me! Now I leave you with peace and I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved, my heart bleeds to see you so defenseless and to see that instead of praying to my Father, you close yourselves in homes. What you cannot see is scary! Why don't you love me, who am close to you! My Mother, who with great pain tells you what you should do, is not listened to, only prayer can save you and do not insist on wanting to understand, because until you believe, the mind of the one who will lead you to salvation cannot be enlightened. Little flock, you can do so much, by praying to my Father with an open heart, go back to rediscover faith, love for your brother and to rebuild peace among you. My beloved, how much pain to see you so defenseless and wounded, pray with my Mother and She will be with you in prayer, to raise your cry to my Father, who even though he loves you so much, is no longer able to look at his beloved children who are they forgive and do not have the courage to bring the Holy Eucharist even to those who suffer, this test is strong. I would like each of you to embrace his cross with love. I bless you in the name of the Father in my Name and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My dear children, thank you for your prayers, remember not to leave the cross, always be with your eyes turned to heaven, do not be afraid because my Jesus is close to you, together with the angels and Archangels, have peace and joy in your heart. Children, love my Son Jesus, take my hands and you will never lack anything, providence will not fail to those who will be strong in the faith. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. Children, I know how much suffering has fallen on humanity, but I will be beside you and I ask you in these difficult moments, reflect and think that only God can be your help and comfort, the time of the battle between good and evil is in act. Get closer to prayer, only in this way will you be able to defeat the evil that grips you. Get ready children, hard times will come due to new pandemics, earthquakes and winds of war. Despite everything, many of you will feel a great peace in your heart, know that it is the grace of heaven, do not fear, I will be with you. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved dear children, thank you for being here in prayer. My beloved children, how frightened you are for all that is happening, but I have touched the earth to warn you and prepare you for all that would happen and many, despite my constant appeals, do not listen. Beloved children, give me your hands and I will lead you through everything that must happen with great protection, stay close to me and to my Jesus and nothing can happen to you. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My brothers, you are all gathered here in this big family, what a joy in my heart! all in prayer as in the past. Beloved children, you who have now become part of my little flock, follow my Mother in your steps, I will accompany you among lions and vipers, no one can touch you, no one can harm you. Dear brothers, how great is my love for you, stay united, because today is the time when each one needs the other, do not leave your brothers alone, but have pity and mercy, as I will have for you, nothing you will miss it. The power of God is so great that my cloak is that of my Mother, it will cover you and make you invisible to evil. My brothers, the world elite wants to subdue you, you have become like subjects, but I will come and free you from all this evil. My brothers, I will go through one by one, I will caress and bless you, as a brother, as a friend, as a father, in the name of the Father in my Name and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. My daughter, do not be afraid, stay with your hand in mine and I will be beside you, I will never leave you, I will follow this mission, be calm. "
"Beloved children, my heart beats with love for you who are united in prayer and have responded to my call in your hearts. My beloved, listen with your heart and look with your eyes at the calls from heaven, take advantage of these days to return to God, this is the last call, because soon the warning will arrive, and do not be caught unprepared. Children, these periods of Passion, use them for fasting and penance. Children, pray for the powerful of the world who have planned all this. The devil does not want to leave the prey, but you children, pray, pray, pray a lot, so that everything that will arrive may be as less painful as possible. Pray for the Church, where my Son is no longer present together with my beloved children, who had the courage to betray Jesus once again and who continue to crucify him. Pray for the Church, it will suffer a serious mourning. Pray for Japan and for subjugated Italy. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My daughter, thank you for being gathered in prayer. Adored children, in this time reflect on what you had and what you have now, everything can change when you are least aware and what will remain for you but faith and love for God, your only salvation? Children, repent with the heart, at this moment your soul is laid bare in front of your smallness. Children, pray for the church because the pain will be great, pray for the consecrated, because many have lost their spirituality and have abandoned themselves to all that is earthly, scattering the flock. My daughter, I place you all under my blessed mantle to protect you because I know what you will encounter. My beloved, you will feel the Holy Spirit descend upon you and your hearts will be filled with joy. Love each other as brothers and help each other, because the worst time will still come and you will be forced to pray in secret, this is the time that will come, be strong and faithful always. Now I bless you the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children and brothers, place peace, love and joy in your heart, if you do so no shadow will persecute you, because you are followed by my hand. Give me your hands and I will take you among clear waters, blue skies and endless meadows, you will be drunk with love. Your life will change forever and do not imagine how much happiness exists together with your God. I understand what you are experiencing, because I too was a man and a man persecuted and crucified, but at my resurrection, you saw the light of eternal life. Follow my steps and I will never leave you, choose eternal happiness. Your Jesus. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer. My beloved, your united prayers rise to heaven like the songs of angels. Adored children, how many tears have I shed for this humanity, remember that in this period, my Son before being Crucified was humiliated, treated as a heretic and slandered, and so too were the prophets who were persecuted in the name and for love of Jesus, so don't be surprised if all this happens today with my children, it's history. I will always protect you, but remember, everything that comes will be mitigated by your prayers, but it cannot be undone because what is written will have to be fulfilled. My beloved ones, I your Mother, I pray that my children, called to the priesthood, return to the true Faith and to the true Magisterium of the Church where purification is taking place. My children, help me in this cry of pain, pray for Italy where the earth will tremble strongly. Pray for India. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Today, Holy Wednesday, was the day when I was betrayed by Judas with a kiss. Walking through the city, the Pharisees looked down on me with pride, arrogance, so even today my church betrays me by looking at me superficially; even great theologians barred the churches, scattering my flock. My daughter, this is the story of Holy Wednesday and of these times; soon the Warning will be upon you, giving you the choice to Love me or Satan. After that, fireballs will come down to earth and it will be the worst time for you, as catastrophes of all kinds will come. My Mother will protect you by putting yourselves under her mantle. Blessed with her, do not be afraid. I bless you all in the name of the Father, in my Name and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, dear to my heart as a Mother, thank you for being gathered here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. My beloved, I ask you to love and embrace the cross, as my Son did. My little ones, I give you the good news at his resurrection, many of you will be risen from the dead in this earth, soon the heavens will open and the Son of God, my Lord will arrive and make new heavens and new lands. Open your hearts to him who died for the salvation of humanity and my Son, everything will forgive you if you ask him with a heart full of love. Children, today many graces will descend on you and you will be filled with the Holy Spirit. Pray children, pray for prayers to reach heaven, many events have already been mitigated. Now I bless you as Mother of all of you, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. Beloved children, I ask to be united even if only in spirit at this special moment, you will soon need each other. I ask those with a contrite heart to forgive and reconcile, otherwise the devil takes strength and does not leave you in peace Dear children, my little children, Satan has forced you to leave the churches and has forbidden communion, therefore, he believes he has already won, but know that he will not win, the Lord will give you love in your heart so that you my children will not get lost. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being in prayer and for hearing my call in your heart Dear children, fight for your freedom, you are about to be enslaved by evil dictators. Beware of vaccines and all obligations because they will not come from God, but from Satan who wants to rule your lives and your minds. My beloved, earthquakes will be heard in every part of the world, I have touched the earth to warn my children, so that they can be ready for the terrible times to come. Children, use discernment, because this is the time when many will be false prophets. Pray a lot and continuously, have only faith in God and keep reading the Holy Scriptures. Adored children, only faith can save you, never forget this. My Angels and Archangels will always be near you, do not be lukewarm. Now I bless you in the name of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My daughter, as on the first day, I ask you once again, to open the doors and your arms, give love, certainty and strength to the children that I will send you. She prepares safe havens for the times to come, the persecution is underway, always be careful. My children, I ask you for strength and courage, pray for the dead who are and who will be, the epidemics will continue, until my children see the light of God in their hearts. Soon the cross will illuminate the sky and will be the last act of mercy. Soon, very soon everything will happen quickly, so much so that you believe you can no longer bear all this pain, but entrust everything to your Savior, because he is ready to renew everything and your life will be a recipient of joy and love, not be afraid, because I will be at your side and soon my Immaculate Heart will triumph with you. Your whole life will be transformed, behold, the Holy Spirit, keep acting. Do not fear, children strength and courage. Now I leave you with my Holy blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Comment: In today's message, Our Lady asks us to prepare safe shelters which are places where prayer is in force and therefore where circles of prayer take place, because where there will be true and heartfelt prayer, evil cannot enter. The greatest refuges are the Immaculate Heart of Mary and of Jesus, so true conversion is needed to be part of it. "
"My daughter and sister, thank you for being here in prayer. My brothers, sweeten my aching and bleeding heart, pray a lot, because what will come will be very painful for the world, but you are not the world, you are my beloved ones who like children come to me with sincere eyes and ask for help and mercy. My brothers, I will follow your minds, and I alone will lead you to right paths, just give me your hands. Brothers, forgive and start preaching for the world so that everyone can know me. Open your hearts, and I will be merciful, but who, despite the times, continues to blaspheme I will have no mercy. Brothers, beware of dictatorships and what they want to oblige you, because they do not come from My Father. Here, the war has already begun. Brothers, never doubt my help, my closeness and my love. Pray for the priests. I bless you all in the name of the Father, in my Name and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Your Dear Jesus."
"Dear children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having accepted my call in your hearts. Beloved children, the powerful have planned everything without taking into account God. It is useless to plan their escape in the face of what will happen because my safe havens will be prayer, sacrifices, penance and what God has already prepared for you. Rejoice children because you will see Jesus descend just as he went away. Beloved children, my Lord suffers so much because He died for you and for your sins, but the world still acts in the wild condition. Pastors do not care for the faithful; the churches are closing and soon the Eucharist will also be taken away from you once again. What comes will cause death. But you still don't understand! I have been sent to warn you, but many do not even appreciate my presence. Pray children! Pray under the Cross of my Son because the earth is full of demons. Man will lash out at man and from there the war will begin. My beloved, entrust everything to my Lord. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. My children, do not lose courage; pray, because only in prayer will you find consolation and infinite joy in your heart; because you will have the certainty that your heart is in the arms of Jesus where only you will be safe. My beloved, so great will your emotion be and so many tears will fall from your eyes for the great joy you will feel when you see what Jesus has prepared for you. Only in this way can you live in joy and true love. I tell my priests: do not abandon the Gospel and the Word; remember that your promises are sacred; be converted before the end of time comes, please help me to take care of souls. Children, pray, pray a lot for the earthquakes that will occur in particular in central Italy. However, rest assured because I will never abandon you. Today there will be many graces that will come down for my children. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being gathered in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. Remember children, treasure the prayers, because it is I who call you; treasure your faith and my Lord, who prays to the Father for you. Beloved children, do not fall asleep, but stay awake and wait ready because no one will know the hour or the day. My beloved, pray for the consecrated to return to God. This current situation has given great trials and here is that when my Son returns, it will be to divide and not to unite, because by now the choice is made; remember the words of the Gospel: one will be taken and the other will be left. My beloved, apostasy has entered the Church as never before. Pray for the mighty of the earth as they are making decisions from which they can never go back. I am your Mother and I cry for the times you will live. Be converted. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. Children, I ask you once again: do not betray my Jesus who loves you infinitely; listen to his voice in your heart because he keeps calling you by name. My beloved, everything will be accomplished in a short time. Don't you realize what the world has become? A handful of rubble because of the devil. Children, there will soon be a strong change. Wait for the strong purifying rain and a strong earthquake that will precede the arrival of my Son, so that peace reigns. Jesus will never abandon you, he loves you, just as I love you. To you, who have said your sincere Yes is forever, you will lack nothing and great protection will come upon you. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My beloved children, do not fear, do not reason with the head, but with the heart. Entrust all your fears to me and I will always be with you. Soon, my Son Jesus will come to destroy the garden that Satan created for himself: do not believe his lies and his illusions. How many unfortunately are part of this rotten garden! Only the Lord will bring happiness, peace, joy and love. My Son is truly dismayed at the profanation of his body that is taking place. Children, enough with silence for fear, but bear witness and sing hymns to the Lord, silence, out of fear, will not bring peace, but it will be a submission to the seductions of the devil. Now I leave you, but know that I am with you. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My beloved, the disorder that surrounds you at times scares some of you, but be patient a little longer and order will return to this land. The price will be a bit expensive because humanity will drink the bitter cup of suffering, but whoever entrusts everything to me and to my Jesus need not fear. Dear children, evil has entered the Church, but in the meantime, you continue in prayer, in the truth and in the laws of God and nothing will happen to you. I ask you, my little ones, do not give way to desecrate the body of my Son; I beg you not to follow the modernism that by now makes the flock falter that no longer knows what is right and what is wrong, but you follow the Gospel and you cannot make mistakes. Now I caress you one by one, continue to be light for the world. I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Your Mother. "
"My children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having accepted my call in your hearts. My beloved, evangelize and cry out that Jesus is coming to save you. I am sad because you do not listen to my words and for the pain you are causing to my Son Jesus. Beloved children, do not tire yourself because now is the time to look around you to see who is in Christ and who is not, this is the moment that yours speak either, yes-yes or no-no! Be light of the world, your light must be so strong that anyone will recognize you. Prepare safe havens, prepare your homes as little churches and I will be there with you. A revolt is ready, both inside and outside the Church. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Beloved children, thank you for being gathered in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My children, look around you, my favorite children are one against the other. I asked you for prayers and I continue to ask for them, because now the priests are against their brothers, the bishops are against the bishops and all this only produces great confusion in the flock. My children, return to God because in this way you will not go anywhere, but only towards total perdition. Nothing will return as before and do not be deceived by Satan because he is the father of lies. Empty yourself of your self and fill yourself with God who is the only true joy. Be in harmony with the sky so that you can calmly face the Warning that is getting closer and closer. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. I will be with you throughout the prayer. "
"My beloved, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. Soon, very soon, the Warning will arrive which will put you in a state of ecstasy that will last about 15 minutes; behold, the sky will turn fiery red; then you will hear a very loud roar, but do not be afraid because it will be the announcement that the Son of God is about to arrive. My beloved children, these are the times in which the Antichrist is about to make his entrance. Later, I'll give you more instructions. Adored children, pray not only to ask, but also to thank my Son Jesus for your peace and your life. I love you children, I will always be next to you. Remember that after the quiet, the storm will come. Pray for the mighty so that God may have mercy on them. Pray for the Church and for the priests. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being united in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. My soldiers of light, be always ready in your heart to fight for my Son Jesus and be ready to be one voice with my angels. My children, do not lose sight of prayer because what you are experiencing is only an illusion of calm, but everything will fall suddenly. Remind all your brothers that the only thing that leads to heaven is the prayer of the Holy Rosary. Always remember this, children! Pray for the Church and for the consecrated people tormented by Satan who are induced to make very painful decisions. Pray for America, because there is confusion. Now I bless you all, one by one, in the name of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My beloved, thank you for being gathered here in this blessed place and thank you for having listened to my call in your hearts. Beloved children, take advantage of this time to draw close to God, not only with prayer, but above all by opening your hearts. I am still here to instruct you for what you will encounter, for all that is prepared for this humanity and for the encounter with the Antichrist who will soon reveal himself as the savior. Children, everything is falling, the pains will be great. If you don't get Jesus into your hearts, you won't be able to have peace, love and joy and face hard times. Children, perhaps you have not yet understood that you are at the beginning of the Apocalypse! Pray for the Church so dear to me, so that it may soon be reborn in the union and love of God. Pray for Japan. Today, there will be many graces that will descend on you and will be the sign of my presence. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Our Lady wore a candy pink cloak and wore a white veil on her head, on her left hand she held three rosaries. "
"Dear children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. Dear children, always remember the words of my Son Jesus: whoever is persecuted in my name will enter the kingdom of heaven. Children, my little ones, what do you fear, know that I will always be at your side. Whatever choice you make, you will be judged. Do not be passive, cry out the love of the only God who made heaven and earth and who will soon renew the earth and the heavens, so that evil returns from where it came, from the depths of hell. My children, look at what is happening in the world: seas entering the cities, earthquakes which will be stronger and more continuous. Children, urgently convert, so that during the Warning you do not feel pain, but love and peace. The Church will be renewed with the little flock remaining and faithful to my Jesus and to the word of my Father. Pray for America and Mexico. Pray for all persecuted and faithful holy priests. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for having gathered here, in this Holy House (Church) for prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. Thank you, children, for having consoled my heart and the Holy one of Jesus. My children, be always ready, here heaven and earth are almost united. Children, I ask you: feed on my Son Jesus who is Divinity, Body and Blood. Gradually, those who despise and blaspheme me, will have only anger and bitterness, while those who believed will keep joy, peace and love. My children, the truth must be shouted without fear and when you cry out the name of Jesus true God, the demons will tremble, but do not be afraid, because great protection will descend on you. Be ready. Do not be discouraged if they insult and persecute you, this is written, because yours will be the Kingdom of Heaven. Winds of war will blow. Pray for Italy and for the priests who are confused at this moment. Consecrate yourselves every day to my Immaculate Heart and to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, only in this way will you be able to mitigate the suffering for the times to come. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My children, Jesus will soon be with you, let yourselves be found with the lamps lit, just like your hearts and with your eyes you will see the wonder of a new life. Children, have a little more patience, evil is about to be defeated by this earth. Everything that has been destroyed on this earth will be renewed, including the Church and faith. How much joy you will feel in your heart! Children, Pray, pray, pray a lot and I will always be close to you. Look at the riots that will take place in the world and look at the skies that will never be the same. Now I leave you with my holy blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. Beloved children, why do you refuse the love and mercy of my Son Jesus, take all that heaven offers you, why do you want to be with a broken heart and without peace? My children, pray, pray, pray a lot, I have asked it many times and I ask it once again, truly convert, it is now urgent, do you not understand that these times are over and when Jesus arrives, what will he find in this land? You will have to be ready for what is coming, persecution will come and you will be forced to pray in secret. Please children, I am your Mother and I want you all to be saved. Announce that Christ is coming, my Father is to purify the earth from the wickedness that has taken possession of souls. Now, I leave you with my motherly blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being gathered in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. My children, today I present myself as Mother of Sorrows for my Church, because she is living her passion of hers and just like my Son Jesus she has been left alone and scourged. My little rest will be persecuted, I cry for the young people who are far from God, I cry for the broken families, I cry for the unbaptized children and for those who grow up in the clutches of evil, I cry for the Shepherds who have left my flock alone, I cry for humanity moving towards self-destruction.

"Dear children, thank you for being gathered in prayer in this place blessed by my Father and thank you for having listened to my call in your hearts. My children, you are here and I look at you one by one, I scan your hearts and I bring your intentions to the Lord, how much love you have within and that is why I call you Children of Light, because with your Faith you are driving, transforming hearts of stone. Children, always have firm faith and remember that where there is faith there is love and where there is love there is God, who is the way, the truth, the life. I love you with all the love of a Mother and I bless you in the name of the Most Holy Trinity, Amen. "
"My brothers, thank you for being in prayer in My House and for having listened to my call. Brothers and children, this time must be of great reflection, many still do not listen to the messages that come from heaven through me and my Most Holy Mother. From autumn onwards, other viruses will appear. Look at what happens in my Church, the behavior of my priests is under the indifferent gaze of those who say they have faith, look at how they are treating me, not caring about my Divinity and Grace, but how they treat me, I will treat them. My brothers, come towards me, give me your hands and I will show you the right way. Brothers, convert, now the times are over, otherwise when I return you will not recognize me and you will not follow me. Children, only I can lead you on the road that leads to my Father. Pray because the earth will tremble extremely. Pray for the Holy Father. Now I bless you in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Children, these times of the apocalypse are times of confusion, of great sadness and tribulation, but always be united to Jesus who is joy and love and only in this way can you be happy. Crosses are for everyone, but I ask you to love them with all your heart. Children, God's love is so great, but we often trust too much in his mercy, forgetting his justice. I ask you faithful and my priests to defend Jesus, do not flee in the face of difficulties. Children, a universal prayer containing several religions is not possible, because in this way Christianity, the only truth, would be abolished. Please children, do not be hypocrites, but be faithful to the Lord and go forward defending the truth. Now, as your Mother I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Children, do not be afraid, I will always protect you, may your prayers for the world elite be incessant because they have succumbed to evil and want to distance you still from one another, they want to gag and enslave you, but do not fear because soon Jesus will free from this dictatorship. Love one another, pray for Italy where earthquakes will be felt and in particular for France. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My daughter, speak with the priests, so dear to my heart and about them: do not pass with indifference before Jesus in the Eucharist, protect the Mystical Body, speak of God's justice, speak of sin, explaining not to offend my Divine Son and make sure that everyone lives according to the commandments, only in this way will there be salvation. My children, you have not yet fully understood what it means to be ready for the times to come, pray, confess, eat the Eucharist and help the brothers who are in confusion. My children, have mercy on my Son who died for you and who will return in all his glory, sing hymns to the Lord and give thanks.

"Dear children, thank you for being gathered here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your hearts. Beloved children, continue in prayer every day, especially in the recitation of the Holy Rosary which is the only protection you will have against evil. Children, look around you, earthquakes, tsunamis, devastating storms will not stop, only the prayer recited with the heart can change something, but everything will have to be fulfilled because it is so written. Abandon your will and always be in the will of God. You are used to living a mechanical life, abandoning the things of the earth and having more consideration for the things of heaven, because only in this way will you be able to take the more difficult but more correct way. Attention children, do not fall into the devil's trap, I love you and I want you to be saved. I wish my army of light could unite in one voice.

It is not the world that will give you eternal life, remember these words of mine, yet I am here to give you myself. My children, come back to me, now the heavens and the earth are united and soon my faithful children will be filled with the Holy Spirit. Now I leave you with my Blessing in the name of the Father in my Name and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My children, give love, express love with your brothers, with those who need your comfort, put love in prayer. Love and hope must be part of your life. It is love that moves all good things, love weakens the devil because he only wants hatred and anger. Remember that love is the attainment of God.

My children, please do not waste any more time looking at the things of the world because it is not there that you will find the truth, but in the word of God and in prayer where you will find everything that you will need. My children, the times that will come will be terrible, God's justice will thunder when you least expect it. I ask for your conversion. Look at the churches, they are empty and the flock is confused because many priests have strayed from the Gospel, help them to preach with courage. You are my children and I want you all safe.

Many of my favorite children (priests) are also persecuted by their brothers, but they need not fear. Children, do not fall into the demonic net, your persecutors are very skilled and convincing, but you go forward with the word of God without deviating from the truth. My children, when the Churches of the world unite with the world powers, then there will be true persecution and you will be forced to hide, because they will skilfully remove the Eucharistic Sacrifice from the Holy Mass.

Now. Children, it is useless to think about a career, to accumulate material goods because all this will no longer make sense. Children, the seas and the hail will enter the cities destroying the crops, this is a land of sin and nature is rebelling, all this will come, so that everyone can kneel before God, recognizing him as the Only God. My children, Jesus he weeps because sin and abomination has entered the Church, he weeps because he loves his Church and despite the profanation He is always there in sorrow and weeping. The time is running out, please children, there is no more time, convert. Look often at the sky, at this moment my angels are fighting against the fallen angels, but you pray, pray, pray and fight on earth for the truth, do not give in to changes because they do not come from God.

My children, this is the time of confusion, especially for my favorite children (priests) who unfortunately no longer know what the right way is to recover the souls that are being lost, but I want to show you the exact way, and it is that of the Gospel, the word of God and the Ten Commandments, only in this way will you find peace and joy in your hearts.

My children, here is that many of my children are not in prayer, but are taken by the things of the world, they have not yet understood that prayer in community is the greatest force against evil. My children, Rome and her Church will suffer their greatest pain for not respecting my will. Pray that the suffering may be lessened, because by now the light in their hearts has gone out. My beloved children, darkness and darkness are about to descend on the world, please help me, even if everything has to be fulfilled, God's justice is to fall down. I ask you in tears once again, pray, pray, pray a lot, because, for those who do not believe, the suffering will be atrocious. Love God, kneel before Him who looks at you with a bleeding heart.

"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, I cry for what will befall humanity, it has turned its back on God and my heart is in pain. Pray above all for the priests, many of them have consecrated themselves to God, but they have chosen the pleasures of the world, so they have made my flock flee that now wanders confused and desperate. Humanity believes it can create its own God, but this is not the case. Children, read the Ten Commandments because today they are no longer respected. You wonder, why will the earth be strongly purified? What did you expect after all the sins committed! Believe in a merciful God and not in his justice. My children, the sky is about to darken, but you still do not listen and you do not see, I ask you, save yourselves by reciting the Holy Rosary, I am beside you and I love you. My loves, have faith and be converted. Now I leave you with my maternal blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "

Children, today I will be crowned before you and before the world, Queen once again. Pray for the Church and especially for my consecrated persons, so that the body of my Son is not desecrated, He has left this Grace for you all. Now I leave you with my Holy and Maternal Blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for having responded to the call in your heart Dear children, I come down again to touch this sinful earth, to help you, to ask and beg you to help me save the lost souls of my children. Evil grips my children like never before, in this moment the devil is wilder than ever because he knows his days are numbered. Your love must be total. You will see people going crazy, you will see unexpected reactions, cursing God for no reason and all this is the fruit of the devil, but you must love, forgive and offer all your discomfort, so that Jesus can transform it into Graces. Children, the God of humanity has been replaced by technology. Be ready at any time for when Enlightenment arrives. Children, your prayers mitigate future events, pray, pray, pray, do not continue to think about trivial things, but spend your time more in prayer than in speaking. Pray for America.

My children, my pain is profound because I see my children getting lost, pray, pray, pray a lot, do not be tired in prayer, pray above all for the Church, so that it may find light. Beloved children, with your behavior you continue to crucify my Son Jesus, because you do not live according to the Gospel and the Word of God. Darkness is about to fall upon this earth, but you still do not believe. I want to prepare you because the times that will arrive will be very hard, Freemasonry and Satanism want to command your minds, everything that will arrive was already ready for a long time, but do not be afraid, trust in forgiveness and Mercy, remember to confess and to convert you urgently. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. Children, bend your knees, for many years I recommend continuous prayer to you, not to be tied to the things of the world, but you have continued to live as if everything were forever. Talk about these times, but do not meditate on what I say through my chosen one, continue as if everything were to change and return as before. My children, the war has begun among you, among the peoples, humanity rejects God, I ask you children, unite in prayer, this is harvest time and this is what Jesus will do. The storm is coming and you continue with useless things, remember that soon, very soon, everything will collapse, they want to dominate your life and your minds. Know that soon you will have to prepare the shelters, by now everything is upon us, you will see many bad things, but faith will save you. Children, open your hearts, love each other and convert, do not be tied to earthly things because they will be taken away from you and you will remain alone with your conscience, ask forgiveness from God, the One who can do everything. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. My children, I feel your hearts and with the pain offered you have touched the grace of the Lord with your hand Dear children, do not torment my chosen ones, because while you fall into the nets of demons, my chosen ones will be filled with grace and peace. My loves, open your hearts otherwise you will not be able to see the door of heaven that is about to open on you. Children, the war is getting closer and closer, pray for America. Now they are limiting your freedom because you do not have the truth inside, convert, the truth will set you free. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for having listened to my call in your heart. My children, speak of the word of God and be lights on in this world. Children, look at the evil that is spreading with speed, all that I had predicted is about to happen, the wars, the natural calamities to which not even science will find an answer and if you are not firm in the faith you will not be able to survive the attack of the evil one. My children, I am always with you and remember that everything beautiful that happens in your lives is never due to your merit, but by the grace of God. Be charitable towards your brothers and do not judge because only God has this task and not of man. Pray, pray, pray a lot, because a new disease will soon arrive. Pray for Italy. I love you and bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My sister and daughter, keep your heart in peace, because what will happen will be terrible in your eyes and those of your brothers. I, your God, have been left alone, I am alone and you are feeling all my suffering. My daughter, many are wondering what will happen again and they do not realize that everything will fall, they have no longer respected the first commandment, they have not believed in the power of prayer and love and they are confused and lost. My sweet darling, my emptied churches have become places of hypocrisy, falsehood and entertainment, but I am there watching and crying for the great disappointment. My sister, accompany me in this pain, so that everything can be lighter, all this will end. My speech will be shortly, the great Thunder is about to arrive. The guerrilla warfare will begin which will turn into war, the times will come where they will continue to keep you at a distance by changing your way of life leading you more and more into sin. The sacraments will no longer be given and everything will be transformed, the lies will be well orchestrated and will convince you to sin more and more. Brothers, I ask you, do not be blind, only with the prayer that will come out of your heart will you be able to see the deception. Now I leave you sweet lovable daughter, offer your pain, you together with your beloved spouse, you are blessed by heaven and by my Father, you will never be alone. Pray for the Church, where apostasy is to be official. Now I leave you with my blessing and you will be anointed every day. Your dear Jesus. "
"My children, where are my children, those who do not believe have turned their backs once again, they do not believe in my Mother's messages. My daughter, she looks, she looks at France, she looks, she will cry for her dead. Humanity and the Church have bowed to the world elite, to Satan who has taken my place. They have terrorized my people and they are massacring the churches, it is not the end of Europe, it is the end of the world. Oh! how much wickedness within my Church, a great smoke will soon rise, I warned, the earthquake would be in the Vatican, apostasy, my children. How much mercy will fall on those who believe, how many graces these children of mine will have. My children, please, [to my consecrated persons], do not abandon the Church, do not scatter the flock, but fight, do not leave everything in the hands of Satan. How will they do, what will my children do without you, be apostles, be lights, now darkness has descended in the Churches. Oh! how much despair, how many people taken by evil, how much my heart suffers, but how much my heart and that of my Mother suffer, I cannot bear to see my Mother in tears, they give me great pain, but you fight, you are always in prayer, pray and do not change anything of what was left to you, soon I will no longer be present in the Eucharist, but you fight to receive it, my angels will approach holy priests, do not be afraid, you will lack nothing. [Jesus shows me the new world and says]: Oh! my daughter, look, this is the wonderful world prepared for you and it will soon arrive. [Jesus prays to the Father]: My Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Father do not abandon them, do not abandon anyone, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Children, remember that God is just and merciful, and yet, despite him being pierced with so much barbarism, He is there with you every day, giving Grace and Mercy to anyone who invokes him. Even if only for a moment, I hope that your conscience opens up, so that you realize the countless mistakes made. Children, be converted because time is over. Pray the Holy Rosary, the only weapon to defend yourself from the atrocities of the world, which make you suffer. Today, many Graces will descend on you. Children, do you remember when Jesus healed 10 people and only one returned to thank Him? Do not repeat this mistake, but testify. I love you children, I bless you in the name of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart Dear children, how your prayers comfort me! Comfort also the heart of the pierced Jesus. Children, as you see, this is a time of great confusion, where evil hides behind false disguises, you will have to be careful, walk together with Jesus and feed on his Word for your salvation. Children, my little ones, they will make you believe that everything will be done for your good, but it is precisely there that the temptation of the devil hides, make discernment. Please live these messages with joy and you will be witnesses of the truth, because whoever follows Jesus will not have to fear anything. If you do not strengthen yourself, you will not be able to face the new diseases that will come. I will pass by to bless you one by one, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, I will be with you until the end of the prayer. "
"My brothers, thank you for being here with joy in my heart, how much faith I see in your hearts. Please, why don't you listen to the most important messenger in the universe, My Mother, She who with her love of her does everything to protect her children in this world of confusion. Please be in silence, in prayer and contemplation, do not speak. Did you want to see the signs of the end times? The signs have arrived and you still do not believe, you have been told that apostasy would enter the Church because of proud, selfish theologians and this happened, upsetting the words of my Gospel. I told you about famines, plague and diseases that would come and you still don't believe. I told you, noises of war will be heard, here they are, everything is already revealed in the Bible (Revelation of John), state against state, governments against governments, men against men, you are afraid of each other, they have taken away your freedom and you still don't believe. Oh! how much faith I will find on my return! Yet, how many trials you could overcome with faith and praying the Holy Rosary. My children, trust and entrust yourselves and I will always be beside you, follow my footsteps and take my hand and I will be with you every day, until the end. Now I bless you one by one, in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having listened to my call in your heart. My beloveds, Jesus suffers for what they are doing to him, Satan is disturbing many souls and is leading men of the Church on the path of pride and pride, and this will lead them to believe that they are omnipotent, walking the path of perdition, but this what pains me is that the flock will be scattered without having known Jesus. My children, on the other hand, God asks you for humility, this is the virtue that will make you recognized as his children. Now, it is time for the real battle and with the weapons of fasting and the Holy Rosary on your hands, fight with me for the Triumph of My Immaculate Heart. Beloved children, the times that will arrive will be terrible, but you do not fear, because I and my Son, we will be close to you in the tribulation. Jesus will bring the Holy Spirit down upon you, just as he did with his apostles. My children, ambassadors and prophets of these times, will suffer most of all, do not leave them alone. Love each other as brothers, be united with love and pray together with devotion. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here and for having listened to my call in your heart. My beloved children, open your eyes to see the darkness that has descended on this earth, winds of war are blowing stronger and stronger. My dear children, I look with pain at humanity that is being lost, part of it has already been lost, I keep telling you, love one another, humanity has transformed into human beings without the Divine Spirit, think of everything what is tied to the earth and you never look at the sky, which with love wants to save you with its signs and with My words to protect you, yet you are blind. My children, look at the Cross of Christ and love it, pray in particular for those priests who are no longer worthy to have the Body of Jesus in their hands, I have already told you that you will return to pray in homes. Children, pray for Italy, because soon the earth will tremble. Pray for America and do not look at the silence of these times, conflicts will soon be felt. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My dear children, remember that from today onwards the spirit of the devil will be stronger, it will invade many minds, please believe my words, get ready for the renunciations they will oblige you to, follow my words. Be like Noah when he prepared The Ark and everyone thought he was crazy, yet he had Faith and saved his family and species of animals. This is the worst time humanity has ever lived, so I ask you my children, have faith and you will be saved, be little, only in this way can you enter the Kingdom of God, no matter how many will despise, judge and persecute you, you will have my Angels next to you, who will make you invisible to evil, especially when you are in your shelters. I ask you that in every house an altar and blessed candles can be erected, My Son and I will be there with you always, do not be afraid, My Lord has overcome death and He loves you. Now I bless you with all the fire of a Mother's love, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My beloveds, this is the beginning of the tribulation, but you will not have to fear as long as you kneel and recognize Jesus, God, One and Three. Humanity has turned its back on God because of modernism and libertinism, but I ask you: who will you go to when all you have now disappears? Who will you ask for help when you have nothing left to eat? And it will be then that you will remember God! You don't get to that point, because He too may not recognize you. My children, do not be like foolish virgins, fill your lamps immediately and light them. Children, remember that silence will lead you to perdition, therefore scream and be no longer in silence. Sing praises and hymns to the Lord, do not be afraid, but be courageous. Accepting even the slightest change in God's Word will be like accepting everything, be vigilant. I ask you to repeat the promises of Baptism where you renounce Satan and all his seductions. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. How beautiful it is to see my children kneeling, by now I rarely see the hearts of people transported by love for Me and for my Son Jesus. My dear children, I already see the divisions that will be created in fidelity to God. My children, I am here to bring love and courage and protect you every moment. In this time those who will be faithful will see the graces doubled so that they can understand God's Mercy how great it is. My children, you will soon be taken by the warning, so prepare yourselves because it will arrive unexpectedly. My dear children, remember that the Truth is the word of God and cannot be mystified, and behold, man has allowed himself to do what is not pleasing to God. Children, remember the words of Jesus: either with me or against me Be with him and you will have joy and serenity even when darkness falls around you. Now I give you my Maternal blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. Listen my daughter, the world in this month will hear the cry of pangs: my Son will be born in the midst of tribulation and spiritual pestilence. My children, be the only voice with heaven, pray, pray, pray children for peace so that it reigns. The prayers of all those who have Faith will anticipate the coming of Jesus Christ. The earth will tremble strongly, the waters will invade the lands, pray for Italy. My children, humanity has passively accepted the will of the world elite without realizing it, the force of the devil is increasingly oppressing this humanity. Children do not be dormant, but cry out the name of the Lord, invoke him, love him and be faithful to him. Many of you do not understand what is happening, but by reading and living the messages with the heart you will understand. I had warned from Fatima, la Salette to today, but indifference has distracted you and made you blind. Here we are at the end of time: it is in front of your eyes, so don't be surprised, but react. Be one choir with the recitation of the Holy Rosary. Pray for China, for America. Now I bless you in the name of the Holy Trinity. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. Children, thank you for the faith and love that I feel in your hearts, but I also feel so many hearts of stone that do not open to grace. I say to these children: take advantage of this moment to remove the impurities from your hearts and begin the journey that leads to Jesus. My children, prayers can change events and please give me your hands and I will lead you to the Redeemer, light, love and mercy. I would like these things in your life, but this humanity has diverted its path by endangering eternal life. Now there is the absence of God in much of humanity and don't say you didn't know, because your behaviors are causing His wrath, but I am here to warn: take the path of light, love the Lord and Him it will transform your hearts by bringing down peace and joy. Now I leave you with my Holy Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Today Our Lady was with Saint Joseph and she was smiling. Our Lady says that today many graces will descend on those present. "
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, I feel little serenity in your hearts but, I, remember that I am with you. My children, even today it is not the true time of persecution, but soon they will impose a single religion on you which will no longer be Christian. Do not think with your head, but ask the Holy Spirit for help who can always help you. You don't have to fear anything when you are with Christ. Now I leave you with my maternal blessing and with Jesus among you. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer and for paying homage to the Immaculate Conception. My children, from here on the Holy Spirit will blow ever stronger on my Church and on her children, remember, have love for the Lord. Dear beloved children, you are my little remnant, be my little flock so that I can always place you under my blessed mantle to protect you. My beloved children, those who evangelize because they have been chosen by me, I want them to be heard because they have the sign of God which is love, joy and peace. Children, I Immaculate and Co-redemptrix of humanity once again invite you to pray a lot in this period. The world and humanity need my Apostles; listen to their voices and join them in the song of Glory to the Lord. I will soon anticipate the return of my Son, do not be afraid I will never leave you alone. You are my children and I your Mother. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

"My children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having responded to my call in your heart Dear children, this is the time to choose. Your choice will have to be for life or death, light or darkness. My children, listen to the words of the forerunner of the Advent of my Son Jesus. My children, do not be distracted and pray because the war between good and evil is already underway, pray with your hands joined to mine, from now on. there will be a succession of events, convert urgently, the time is over. Now I leave you with my Holy Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear my children, thank you for your 'Yes' every day. My daughter, write so that it can reach everywhere. My beloved children (priests) I have given you the light and you have embraced the darkness, I have consecrated you and you have embraced the world, repent and ask forgiveness for what you are doing to my Church. Ask the faithful for forgiveness for feeding them so many lies. Don't you know that you are making choices that will be rewarded with eternal fire? Repent and gather the flock with love, mercy and teach the way to sanctification. Hear the din of earthquakes, listen to volcanoes awaken, look at this humanity that has lost its values ​​and love, but is filled with pride and arrogance, forgetting humility. I look at you and you have become like a robot, devoid of any humanity. Save yourselves because the wrath of my Father is already upon you. Love each other among brothers and be faithful to God, return to Him who is the only true love. Now I leave you with the blessing of the Holy Trinity. Your dear Jesus."
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your heart. My children, the world is without God, everything is without God: men, politics, the mass media have passively accepted what the devil suggests to complete the work of destruction, but you beloved children, you are not alone, remember that we are with you. Children, in this special Christmas, use calm and joy for the coming of the Savior who, as then, will come in humility. Do not be afraid, manage it with prayer, whoever is in Christ has the certainty that he will not be touched. Children be united, you will need each other; famine will soon arrive and you will have to be ready to help each other among brothers. I love you and console you when you invoke me. Italy will tremble very strongly, pray! Now I leave you with my motherly blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. Children, my little ones, I, your Mother, am always with you. Remember that this is the worst time that humanity has ever lived but, despite everything, this is the time of Blessings, the little flock will be blessed to make it strong in facing any event. Look deep into your heart and you will find the joy of a renewed life, the strength with which even evil can escape before you. The Lord has so many gifts in store for you, rejoice at the Savior's arrival. Pray for America because the clashes between politicians and between brothers will be very strong. Be careful, there will be avalanches soon. Now I leave you with my Holy Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"My bride, You are here waiting for your husband. I have brought these families together because I want you to share the love, the love of a true family, a strong love. I too was born into a family full of love and just like me, you must give and be examples of my great love. Let your families be examples of unity, strength and love, raise your children with love so that they can teach others. Everyone is waiting for my birth! Someone comments on the messages that my Mother gave to humanity saying: who knows what will happen, when it will happen, we will see with time. Believe what you have been told because the time is up, then the Warning is near. I will return in Glory while my angels will put the crown on the King who is born, I will return with my power, with my love and with my greatness. Everyone will believe me and sing hymns to the Lord together with my angels, I will return to take you home where you deserve joy and prosperity. Keep your families together, forgive past grudges, love one another as I love you. I love you more than anything else in the world. Now wait and pray. I caress you one by one, reminding you of my love for you. Love me my bride love me and you will look forward to the joy of my world. I love you. Thank you for welcoming me into your home. I bless you in the name of the Father, in my Name and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"Dear children, I am the Immaculate Conception, I come to instruct you once again for the times to come. My beloved children, because you still talk about the things of the world planning your future and counting on earthly things, I advise you to think more about spiritual things. Do not be angry at what is happening around you, unfortunately the worst enemy of man is the Ego, which this humanity does not have the strength to totally eliminate from its life. Be assured my children, that each of you will have the responsibility for your actions before God and towards your neighbor, forgive because what will come will be much worse than what you are experiencing, diseases and viruses will be worse, but you have only one cure, prayer and constant entrustment to God. My children, you are not alone and do not be afraid, the only important thing is to choose which side to stand on, because this will be the final bill for eternal life. Now I leave you with my Maternal blessing together with that of my Father who loves you immeasurably. "
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer and for having responded to my call in your heart. Children, look at the world, it has come to destruction. I have asked and continue to ask you to pray the Holy Rosary and to entrust yourselves to God, your only salvation. You are walking a road full of dangers and yet you do not believe, open your hearts, be united and be one family, so that you can help each other. Soon there will be many things that you will see, you will also be witnesses of the end of this battle and together with Jesus, you will be victors, do not fear. How many believe that all this will pass quickly; you let yourselves be shaped by what the powerful, the world elite say, without understanding what was happening. Be careful, what they tell you will not always be for your good. Pray for Italy and for the world in great danger. The Vatican will be very shaken, many prelates will feel the darkness in their hearts, I entrust myself to your prayers, beloved children, so that what will arrive can be mitigated. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. "
"I, your Father, am here with you to tell you important things for this coming year. My children, follow my Jesus, only by trusting can you attain the salvation of your souls. I have given you my daughter, a mother for you. As a good Father, I want you to know Me as I am. Teach your children My name and when you address Me, call Me Father, not just God, but Father. I, who am Father of you all, how could I not love My children. From time to time My justice serves to correct you because you do not always listen. Look, look at the sky and be submissive to Me as the God of peace, be humble. But what do you think, that I can enter your heart if your heart is closed to grace? It will never be possible and instead open your hearts and I will be there to give you everything you ask for and nothing will be lacking. Pray with the simple prayers you have been taught, nothing else, I do not want anything else. Oh! My children, if you only knew the joy you give Me by looking at you together and united, just because you do not see Me you think I am not there, but I am listening to you and I am watching you, I am watching your hearts and your joy. Soon I will come to take you, soon my Jesus will take you and bring you into a new world. What do you think, that you have only in this world to do? But my world is also full of commitments. Oh yes, give only joy, peace and love, these are the things you will have to do. I will be close to you, the joy in your heart that you feel is only my joy and your love is my love. I am in each one of you and you have not yet understood. Seek Me and you will find Me. I am also in those who do not know Me. I know who you are and I have created you in love, humility and mercy and you have created the god of yourselves. Entrust everything to the only Father you have and to Mary, merciful and pious Mother, humble handmaid of God, who is leading you on the way of holiness. Pray her Rosary for your salvation; sometimes even simple words are needed, which I appreciate. My sweetest children, make an ark, just as I asked Noah, but I asked him so that he could bring all his children to me, without losing a single one. To you My children, I do not ask you to build an ark, but be a big family and gather as many souls as possible. Soon you will need each other and how will you do if Heaven does not give you these instructions? Listen to this beautiful soul, she is my love. Oh! My love, how I love you, how beloved you are in My eyes, continue on your way and tell your brothers to do only My will, they were created for a mission, they were created only for this and yet they are lost. My daughter, Love of My Heart, put them on the right path as a mother does with her children, explain to them that I love them, tell them how great My love is for them, they are My children and I am their Father. Turn to Me, call Me Father and in no other way, Father, as I call you children. Remember that only through My Jesus and His Cross will you have salvation. Oh! My children, I now bless you in the name of the Most Holy Sacred Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, be united always in my name and I will be with you, Amen. Finally, Our Lady added: Pray, pray very much because strong will be the tornadoes and cyclones that are preparing."
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer and for answering my call in your hearts. My children, light the candles of faith and continue with prayer; at this time, we need you Christians and those who are in the truth. My children, pay attention because all that is about to happen should open your eyes and make you see that God's justice and chastisement are upon you. There are many nations that have turned their backs on God's laws by making their own laws that have nothing to do with the divine. My children, pray for those who have promoted abortion laws, for their suffering will be great. My children, the road of the antichrist is opening, but be serene because the fire of the Holy Spirit will be upon my children who will not be deceived. Now I bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Extraordinary message: During the Holy Mass, at the moment of the Eucharist, Jesus told me: all those who have received the gift of the Holy Spirit and have lived it, during the difficult moments that will come, the Lord will be with them and they will be in peace and joy, while those who have not lived in the Spirit, will continue their journey in despair and darkness, Amen."
"Dear children, I am here your Mother, I come to you to ask for patience, mercy and love. This, my children, is the time of persecutions, but you pray, pray so much without rest, so that you may recognize the wolves disguised as lambs, everything around you does not always come from God, so be careful. My children, unfortunately betrayals will continue to exist, even my Son chose his Apostles one by one and yet he was betrayed, the history of the Saints repeats itself in every one of my beloved children and in every time. My children, seek peace among your brothers and stay in silence even though you are right, rest assured, my angels are here to guard you. Remember that the sufferings offered to the Lord will turn into Graces, especially if you suffer for Jesus, do not fear, the important thing is the peace you feel in your heart at this moment. I do not leave you alone, be certain that I am always with you. May peace be in your homes. I now bless you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, thank you for being here in prayer, bend your knees. I am here to welcome you into my heart and to grasp your hands. My children, do not be afraid and agitated for what will happen, but trust me, nothing will be lacking if you invoke Jesus. He will be your supply, He will be the warmth in the cold, He will be the light in the darkness, He will still be your food and He will satiate your thirst because everything is in Him. My beloved ones, do not waste time, approach the faith with an open heart. I am not here to frighten you, but to warn you, the times that are coming will be darker than what you are experiencing now, but if you do not light the flame of faith, you will feel only despair and torment in your hearts. My children, I call you to redemption; the greater your suffering, the stronger you will rise; I want you all to be saved. You take up the sword of love and God will do justice. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, thank you for responding to my call in your hearts. It comforts me to see you kneeling in prayer. My children, God has allowed me to come to you to take you by the hand and bring you closer to prayer. Oh! My wandering children who do not find the light, still so many do not listen to My word, do not appreciate My help so much as to mock these messages for the salvation of humanity. My children, you have had time for your choice and, if I look at the hearts of many of my children, I weep with pain and my Son's heart bleeds. Children, now you will see what I never wanted your eyes to see: very strong earthquakes and all calamities such as storms, blizzards, tidal waves and wars, because you did not listen to my words! You are enslaved, you are persecuted for your faith, yet everything passes as if it were normal. My children, the war you are witnessing is not with bombs, but it is a rather strong inner war. Pray for the Church, which will suffer its destruction before the Rebirth. My children, be surrendered to My Jesus and we will always be close to you. Now I leave you with My Motherly Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, bend your knees in prayer. I would like to console you by telling you that every word, every gesture, every glance turned to Me, the King of Heaven and Earth, will be blessed even more in this time. I look at you and I see your hearts and I bless you and I give you My peace that you in turn will bring to your homes. I love you and I am always here, I wait for you every day like a poor beggar, I ask only for Love. Your Jesus."
"Beloved children, thank you for being here in prayer and for responding to my call in your hearts. Beloved children, I urge you to decide which side you are on. I, your Mother, am here, waiting for your call to give you many graces, I speak especially to humanity that has given itself to the world. Call me, invoke me and I will always be ready to come to your aid. Children, Warning is near, I ask my little remnant: clothe yourselves with light and put on the most beautiful armor, and I will put you in the front row, now I need you, you will be protected and made invisible by my angels, evil will continue to take souls away from hell and here you will have to apostolate and evangelize with great courage and faith, be brave and shout the truth, do not be afraid. My children, love and be anointed, put all your sorrows in the most precious wounds of my Son. Now I leave you with my Motherly Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My daughter, tell the world that faith is the only hope humanity has, only prayer, mercy and love will be their salvation. The times foretold from Fatima has arrived, no one will be able to say that I did not warn. Many were the prophets and seers chosen to announce the truth and the dangers of this world, yet many did not listen and still do not listen. I weep for these children who are lost, the apostasy of the Church is becoming clearer and clearer, my beloved sons (priests) have rejected My protection. My daughter, tell the world to pray for the powerful, for they will unleash a great war. Pray for the Church, for it is at its destruction, pray for Italy for it will mourn its dead, famine is near and you are not prepared. Another virus is at the doors and it will be worse than the previous one. My children, why do you still not understand? Protect yourselves, pray, pray a lot. Baptize and pray for the children, because evil wants to take their innocence. Now I leave you with the blessing of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Then she adds: read the Revelation and there you will find the truth for these times."
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your hearts, it comforts me to watch you in prayer with faith in your hearts. My children, look at what is happening around you, natural disasters have not waited in the world and will continue. My children, these are the times, the arm of God can no longer be held, His justice will be great, sometimes atrocious on those who blaspheme His Holy Name, for those consecrated children who have profaned the Church and had no mercy on how much pain they caused my Son. Children, do not believe this world that wants to corrupt you in the best of ways, making all evil pass as lawful. Beware of the enticements of the devil who in these times and with so many sins he has gained strength. My children, your faith will save you, ask with faith and it will be given to you, knock and it will be opened to you, invoke My Name and that of Jesus and we will not leave you alone. I love you and I am close to you. Pray for America, for the priests and the Pope. Pray for the powerful of the world, that their hearts may be enlightened and that peace may reign on earth. Now I leave you with my Motherly Blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, thank you for listening to my call in your hearts. Beloved children, thank you for your prayers. I, your Mother, am here, touching the earth to instruct you, a mother who lifts you up when you fall, who lifts you out of the mud and where some creatures are; it is always I who wipes away your tears, who gives you back hope and the light of my Son to light your way. My children, I am your Mother: why do you not take advantage of the Mercy that descends upon you to change your lives? Beloved children, pray for the Church, for by now the struggle is at the doors, she will live her passion. Pray much, without ceasing. A strong storm will shake the world and you are still wasting your time by tying yourselves to earthly things. My children, everything is ready for you, milk and honey will come down from the mountains; peace, love and much serenity is ready for you; but I ask you, believe and live my messages. My children, today many graces will come down, witness, be grateful to God for so much love, recognizing Him as the only true God. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, thank you for responding to My call in your hearts. My children, many of you are waiting for the Warning as if it were only mercy, but remember children, it will also be an event that will surgically expose your lives. My children, I have come among you to put together My small faithful remnant. My children, do not be like the Pharisees, do not be false, remember that I see your hearts and nothing can ever be hidden from Me. Children, always testify and have courage, sometimes you feel the fear of others' judgments as did the Apostles and some of them for fear denied Jesus, yet they were chosen by Him. My children, pray for the powerful of the earth, so that they do not take the path they have in mind, for on their plans will depend my children and their future, wars are planned. My children, I am here and I love you. Make circles of prayer everywhere, today the world needs you, pray for the Church and for your rulers. I leave you now with my motherly blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. My children, you who welcome me into your hearts I say, Jesus is closer than you imagine, my little ones everything is ready for you and never fear when you are in Christ. My children, pray for the times that are coming because it will be a succession of dramatic events and great signs and it will be difficult to doubt where they are coming from, except for those who are already on Satan's side and for those whose hearts are closed. My children, I weep for Rome who has turned her back on God thinking more of power. Oh! Rome, soon she will eat the dust of her ruin. My children, pray for Southern Italy. My children, pray for America because it obeys diabolical plans. Children, I remind you that prayers have mitigated many events, please continue in prayer, you are on the ascent of Golgotha and you are carrying crosses, make fasts and sacrifices. Now I leave you with my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, thank you for being here in prayer. My sweet children, how I would love to put you in the front row among my fighters, my soldiers of light, be worthy, love my Jesus, do not be gloomy, but love diligently. Children, many of you in this period will be transformed and filled with the Holy Spirit to be able to have our light, many others will feel empty, almost with the feeling of not having the comfort of God. This condition will make you suffer a lot, but don't be afraid, God will never abandon you, this state will make you understand how it is when even unconsciously you walk away and where you could go. Remember that this suffering will instead be for the elevation of your Spirit. Children, we are preparing you for the Warning, you will come back stronger than before, in faith and in prayer, so do not fear, suffering will bring Grace. Pray children, because unjust men will make fun of this humanity, leading it towards the abyss, but you fight and love and no one will touch my faithful remnant. Now I leave you with my Motherly Blessing, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My loves, thank you for the prayers you recite even in silence, every gesture, every word addressed to God is a prayer. My children, I continue to ask you to be lights for the world and swords for defense, we will give you the utmost protection, but you pray, speak of God calmly and gently, explain what will be said to you from heaven without fear because the Holy Spirit will accompany you. Children, pray for Russia, China and America, they will be a cause of turmoil for the world. Revert to God the Savior without any doubt, be bound to the true doctrine. Pray for those who fear these moments of darkness that are coming, I say to them: do not fear because you must only aspire to Heaven, there are so many useless deaths in the world because you are lowering your heads to the world's elite, be careful My children, evil is taking advantage of your spiritual and physical weakness to attack you, for this reason I ask you to be strong in faith because only in this way can you endure, renounce and go on evangelizing. My children, volcanoes will awaken almost simultaneously, nature is turning against this ungrateful and sinful humanity. My children, pray for the Church, the schism is taking place, the Church will rise again, unfortunately my beloved children (priests) have chosen the way of falsehood, bringing down darkness on the faithful, remember that for all your behaviors you will be accountable to God, you are leading my flock to sin, you are no longer considering sin, what you teach is no longer the true Magisterium and for this you will be accountable. Darkness is about to descend on this earth and the signs of Heaven will be more and more imposing, convert now. The Antichrist is about to appear publicly taking the appearance of a saint in his ways, he will also speak of God, but be careful children, be careful! Always live my messages and gather as many souls as possible. My daughter, thank you for always being faithful to me, Jesus will be beside you and I will console you in this Easter offering. Now I leave you my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"My children, how much I suffer, I am among you, I weep for all the suffering that is being caused me. Beloved children, oh how much I suffer! What my Church is doing to me! I am already here and humanity still does not believe, it does not understand how much pain I feel and how much pain for this Church of mine; it has turned its back on me, yet I have built it together with Peter, it is my Church and I will not let the devil take possession of it, but it will be reborn in Glory. My children, beware of false doctrines, do not fall into this trap. My beloved ones (priests) will give an account for what they are doing! Pray for the true priests, those of Jesus Christ, for persecution is taking place. Sing hymns to the Lord your God, lament over all that will happen and shout that I am here. My children convert now, pray, pray, pray so much, the times that will come will be for the purification of the earth, nothing you know will remain on this earth and you who still think of earthly things. Confess and be ready because the time is at the limit. Be ready in prayer, be in My Grace. My daughter, bear my suffering with joy, this will be a special Easter. Look my daughter, look at this precious blood, it is for everyone even for my ungrateful children and sinners who do not understand. My daughter, how much you will suffer this Easter, how much suffering for all sinners, help me my love, help me, do it with joy for your Lord. I am here to purify you. Now the Holy Spirit will descend upon you, I want to purify you all, be ready because you will not be able to bear what awaits you. Why do you insist on the things of the world? Forgive, love, have mercy, do not be indifferent. My Spirit is among you and will remain with you. My children, stay together more than before, help each other because soon all will be lost. The fire and the water are preparing, but you will be kidnapped by my Angels and taken to a safe place until it will rise again as a paradise: in a new era, in a new earth, with new heavens. Follow me and my footsteps, I am the truth, the way and the life. This house is blessed, where My angels will dwell to protect you. My children, do not be afraid of anything, I have marked you one by one, as Satan marked his faithful. My children, how many souls have you gathered to Me, how many souls! Now I will pass by one by one to bless you, kneel down and bow your heads, have eternal life, in the name of the Father, in my Name and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Your dear Jesus."
"My children, thank you for always welcoming me into your hearts. Beloved children, look around you, this is a time of destruction, confusion and above all of choices, you are invited to decide which side to take, so I say to you: there is only one way to make the right choice, follow the Gospel, the Word of God and be in prayer, let His light enter your hearts, only in this way will you be able to understand which will be the main road. The falsehoods of this world are more harmful than any disease, look how many suicides especially of children, the devil is in all his strength, for this reason I ask families, teach your children prayer, explaining that only through it you can have peace and serenity in your hearts, because without the light of God there is darkness. Baptize your children, so that they may set out on the way to a holy life. My children, the world and humanity are on the precipice, strengthen yourselves in faith and prayer because soon the antichrist will make his appearance. My children, also have hope that everything will be renewed so that there will be a new world of peace, hope and love, everything is ready for these events, but you will first have to pass through tribulation and persecution, look at the signs, be courageous, we will be beside you. My children, repent and convert to the one true God, God of peace, love, mercy and justice. Now I leave you with my blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
"Dear children, thank you for having responded to my call in your hearts. Blessed children, many are my tears shed for those who still do not listen to me, who do not live the messages, which have been accompanying you for years so that your life may change and your heart may open to grace. My children, at this moment the world is under the dominion of evil which has now stopped hiding and openly wants you as its subjects; democracy is over and dictatorship has emerged. My children, I ask you to be firm in the faith, otherwise you risk losing all the way you have undertaken until today, love Jesus and the cross and you will have salvation. My children, this is a time of great trials and purification, I ask you not to be drowsy, but keep watch, pray children, pray a lot and have joy in your heart and peace despite everything, this is faith. I love you all because you are all my children. Now I leave you with my motherly blessing in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen."
