2009,1,0,Jesus Christ,January,"My dearly beloved people, I come to you as a merciful Father. Today My Divine Mercy descends upon all of mankind. Don’t see me as a severe judge, but rather as a merciful Father. Today I come to call on you as an essential part of the human race. My heart greatly rejoices at the sight of my people who walk hand in hand with My Mother and with the help of my dearly beloved Saint Michael Archangel. My people are solid, strong, and will grow at this time, but its growth will depend on how much love there is among them. Thus, the foundations and the walls of my children will be strong and impenetrable if they live in love. But a love in spirit and truth, ‘a true love like the love I have for you’. If you live this way, nobody will be able to penetrate the fortified walls strengthened genuine love. Beloved, at this time, the whole mankind agonizes, and when something is in the state of agony, the birds of prey circle, circle, over and over the place. There are marauders like birds of prey around my children, do not forget that birds of prey look for corpses, and there are no corpses among my people who are creatures filled with My Spirit, full of love and faith. I only wish to remind you of this, so keep it in mind. My beloved people, at this time, more than at any other time, like strong warriors you must defend my church with tenacity and earnestness, with much, much, much faith, with nobility and courage. When my Priests have Me in their hands and pronounce the words of the Consecration, you must lift your face and look at Me because your King is in front of you. You must look at Me, see my glory, my splendour, my own Flesh, my own Blood and Divinity in front of you. You must not lower your heads to the floor because I am not on the floor; I am in front of you. Lift up your eyes. Look at Me. In this way you venerate Me by looking at Me, loving Me, and adoring Me. My beloved people! My beloved people! My beloved people! Of the three expected periods of time, you are now in the last moment of the third one. The cup is already spilling. It has tumbled over and will continue to spill over all of mankind until it is empty. When I look at Creation so perfect - Creation which emerged from My Father’s hand with His Divine breath and filled with His love, how my Heart suffers and bleeds now when I see that Creation humiliated, downfallen, immersed in sin! How my Heart aches! Have you asked yourselves why the human race has fallen so low? And why does mankind chastise itself so much? I do not punish you, my children. It is you who punish yourselves because you have wanted to place yourselves at the same level with Our Trinity. You have wanted to create life as Our Trinity creates life, and to kill disregarding Our Divine Will. This is the main cause of the punishment man is inflicting upon himself. This is the root of all evil. Beloved, open the eyes of your brothers by becoming tactful and kind messengers of peace and love. Make them realize that that which We have been announcing for so long and was already written will come to pass, because nothing comes to pass before I announce it to my people, my Israel. You are my Israel, because my Israel are my faithful ones, those who commit themselves to Me, those who resurrect with Me, but before resurrecting they pass through the crucible. It is in this crucible where man will continue to whip his fellowmen. Beloved, how my Heart suffers! How great is the pain! In spite of the spiritual and material shortage in which they find themselves, the great majority of my children do not turn their eyes towards Me. They must still punish and mortify themselves even more in order to ransom more souls. We know that a great majority of people will follow the antichrist, who is in Belgium at this time. How much pain, how much suffering, how much spiritual hunger, how much desolation he will bring to My Church! Be prepared! My Israel will suffer a great deal. It will be persecuted again. No country will escape the persecution. When you read the Scripture, you marvel at how much my people were persecuted. Yet you will have to live it in your own flesh because all my faithful people in the world will be persecuted again because the evil one knows the power and the reach of my people’s prayers. You are the support of an endless number of souls. This is why you must remain faithful and whole in integrity, in one single line, in one single column. How much spiritual corrosion is out there! How much disobedience from my children towards Me and My Mother! She cries tears of blood because She knocks on one door and another and the majority of the people do not respond. The unbridled sexual licentiousness, the disintegration of the family, the stubbornness of the young people, the drug addiction, the alcoholism and the depravity of man who sinks in the abyss, have brought mankind to the same level as that of Sodom and Gomorrah. As these wicked cities perished in sin, so will mankind punish itself. Raise your voice to the divine throne, raise your voice. We never leave you alone, not for a moment; but you must cry out and change. Man, himself has written his destiny. How many opportunities has my Mercy given to the human race! How much has my Mercy delayed the fulfilment of everything! Yet man continues submerged in sin and arrogance, challenging Us, challenging Our Holy Trinity. Full of Mercy, we forgive and We love. We forgive and We love. We forgive and We love. However now I must tell you again, you are living in the last of the three periods of time of the human race, and this time is ending. It is ending. That is why the fulfilment of all which has been announced is in the blink of an eye. This is it. In previous occasions I have announced the suddenness of these events, but now it’s in the blink of an eye. That is why there will be tangible events, beginning with the fall of the great empires which attribute to themselves the dominance and the power over the small nations and the oppressed nations as you are witnessing right now. The northern country (the United States of America) will fall due to the pride of its governing leaders. The country will chastise itself and, in its desperate desire to rise again, it will sell itself to another, in such a way that the communists (China and Russia) will unite and devastate many countries until they reach the northern country. The Great Conflict, the Third World War, is at the door. As Israel started the Alliance, so now, through its conflicts, it will start the spark of the Great War. I have spoken to you about the fall of the economy, of a small respite, and again a greater downfall from which the world economies will never recover. This is where you are heading. Don’t sustain false hopes. This is why those who have in their hands the blessing of publishing my messages and my constant calls to mankind must do so urgently, since soon, very soon, they will not be able to publish my messages again, even if they so desire. It is necessary that you continue safekeeping the material with which you will evangelize. I call on you to prepare yourselves. Do not neglect a single second. Stay alert, attentive because everything is in the blink of an eye. All the world economies will fall, but—as is always the case—the smallest countries are the ones to suffer the most. That is why I want you to share with your brothers from other countries this desire of mine, that you learn how to till the ground to plant what each one will need for sustenance in order to cater to your own needs little by little. I have given you intelligence and the power to reason so that you may take some personal decisions under the light of My Holy Spirit. There are two times, two moments of which I talk to you today. One of the them is the time of affliction and the tragedy that will befall the human race with no chance of going back. Everything moves and moves; each time it is nearer and nearer. The other time is one of blessing. That is why I have told you that I come as a Father of Mercy, because my Mercy comes to all the faithful. How does it come? With My Holy Spirit, with the plenitude of My Spirit in man. Now there are two transcendental moments. One is the spiritual downfall and the economic collapse of the human race. The other one is the plenitude of My Holy Spirit. However, since my creatures are not all equal, some understand perfectly; others, moderately; and others hardly understand at all. This call to become one, to forgive, and to overlook the mistakes of others is urgent. And this is for everybody. Families must be united. They must remain united to protect themselves and withstand till the end. At this moment the enemy is charging against the family. Today I command you that there be peace among you and within your families. I desire an equilibrium. I desire an equilibrium, so there will be peace, love, and stability. You gain more with love than with harshness. You gain more with a kind well-said word than with rudeness. My people, My Israel is a strong column. Having already known the calls of My Mother in Fatima and many other places of the world where She has announced that at the end of time My Church will be persecuted, they must pray, and pray, and multiply the praying. All prayers arrive at our throne. So, cry out! Multiply the petitions and supplications for those who refuse to respond to My Mother’s calls through so many dear souls throughout the years, throughout the world. You must pray for my dearly beloved Peter. He is extremely persecuted, even by some who call themselves My seers. So, pray for him. Pray for My Church in general. Pray also for yourselves. Beloved, you must understand that the fullness of My Spirit in man is the triumph of My Mother’s Immaculate Heart. It is for this that My Mother has fought. It is not for her own triumph on Earth, but for the triumph of the fullness of My Spirit in every human creature. That is My Mother’s triumph. It is not only the triumph of the woman clothed with the sun, but also the triumph of the woman who fights for the fullness of My Spirit in mankind for My return. And that is My return, My coming back, the fullness of My Spirit in the human creature. My Mother wins, but not for her. It’s for Our Trinity. Don’t forget to pray the Holy Trisagium (Trisagion). It is a powerful prayer. Ah! But the Sacrifice where I immolate Myself—the Holy Mass, the Holy Communion - is crucial for all My children because when they receive Me in Holy Communion, I give them My strength and, in you, we bring strength to others. So, in this last sigh of the human race, in this final third age of mankind we must be fused into one single heart and, with all your might, you must strive to obtain the fullness of My Spirit in you. I am well disposed. As a loving and merciful God, I am in front of you with outstretched arms full of My gifts. Only be true to Me, so that I can give you My treasure. Prepare all that which I have requested of you throughout the years. Announce to the entire world that they must prepare themselves spiritually in order to withstand the attack of the one who comes coveting to usurp My Church. We will prevail. We will prevail, my Israel. I will not leave you alone. We will prevail, and you have my blessing, you have my protection, and at this moment I renew the ancient covenant with the new covenant, that is my blessed mother, and I make them one. At this moment, I unite the Old Testament with the New Testament and I bless my people. I send them my spirit to dwell in them so that always—in time of prosperity, in time of shortage, in time of struggle, and in time of happiness—they may be light and reflection of my love and my word among mankind. Let the prayers which come out of the mouth of My faithful Israel be multiplied to infinity. Let them make up for the prayers of those who do not pray, do not supplicate, do not repent, do not implore. May all your deeds and acts be multiplied to infinity for the good of all mankind. I want you to send this My word to the entire human race. ‘He that has ears to hear, let him hear. Pray strongly. Do not forget the prayer of the holy rosary and the Trisagium (Trisagion). At this moment I fortify you with the power of My Holy Spirit that you may withstand—and in you, the rest of the human race—the snares of the antichrist who is now planning strong warfare against My Church. However, we will resurrect. We will resurrect. I bless you in the name of My Father, in My name, and in the name of My Holy Spirit. Amen. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,1,0,Holy Mary,January,"My beloved people, when calling attention anew to my beloved children, I must remind you of the infinite responsibility that you have as children of the Father; this is the reason for which I continually call you to remain faithful to the Church. Give due respect to the constant calls of My Son, do not forget He is the King and in the presence of the King every knee bends, every creature remains silent. Many read in the book of Revelation about the New Jerusalem, about the Holy City, about the tribulation, the persecution, about the trumpets and vials and they look at it in this moment as something that happened. However, today I must tell you that it is a reality that is upon humanity. The calamity that man has forged upon himself continues to grow for time does not pause, time continues at its accelerated pace thrusting all of humanity towards a devastating encounter with its future. How much pain awaits humanity in all scopes, in all fields! and it is for this reason that today I call you to value this moment and to not allow that anything or anyone lead you astray from the path. Soon you will see unleashing of the persecution of Christians; the people loved by this Mother, will be persecuted by those who, not loving My Son, will see in every Christian an enemy. Soon, very soon you will see how violence, theft, kidnapping will increase in an uncontrollable manner. Beloved children, perhaps in the last days there has arisen in you some confusion about the resolutions of My beloved Peter, Benedict XVI, but today I must only tell you, that he is letting the fulfilment of the prophecies take its course. He is walking toward the encounter of the fulfilment of the prophecies; for that reason, does not judge, only pray. Like My Son walked towards the fulfilment of the Will of the Father, today My Peter walks, even though his life hangs on this. Love, love the Church, love her, do not separate yourselves from her! My Son covers her, My Son protects her, My Son built her and My Son will lift her up and resurrect her forever and ever. No one, no one will triumph against the Church. And you, love one another in a single heart, in a single voice, pray, make reparation and pray, for you maintain the equity between heaven and earth! I love you profoundly, you should be a candle, and you should be light for your brothers. A candle is not solely for illuminating darkness, it is to shine at all times, it is to distinguish one self, to break your way out. I will help you; I will guide you and protect you. Like I received My Son’s disciples, I accepted all of you at the foot of the Cross in order to walk united, in order to be your intercessor, until you are reunited with the Father. Remain in the peace of God. Your Mother.",,,,,,,
2009,1,0,Archangel Michael,January,"Beloved people of God, I come to tell you that I walk in front of you with my defending sword. Remain alert, alert at all times so that you do not fall into temptation. You are warriors, warriors of peace and love; warriors that will defeat the enemy with prayer; warriors that with prayer will defeat demons, warriors that will vest the armour of love, of patience and of mercy. You are my warriors, and together we will be victorious. Today I call you to love one another more than at any other moment. This is the mission of the children of God; I call you to act in love, with sanctity and purity of heart; today I call you to respond immediately, to the First Commandment. You do not see all that is coming; you do not see the strength with which the enemy approaches mankind. Our King, does. For that reason, He sends me to call you so that you pay attention to respond with urgency, having the certainty that I have the Divine Mandate to defend the children of the Most High. This is the reason for which I remain in front of you with my sword held high, defending you and protecting you so that the enemy does not touch you. Have this for certain, evil will not touch you because I, Saint Michael, defender of mankind, am called to remain before the faithful and obedient, protecting them and defending them. Do not forget the Divine Mercy, since there are those who fall and do not get up; they let themselves get carried away by human weakness and they get to the point where they fear the evil one so much, that they forget about the infinite power of God. You are not people that walk alone; get up, do not remain in the mire of sin, be love. Remain firm and faithful. United we will triumph. Saint Michael the Archangel.",,,,,,,
2009,2,0,Jesus Christ,February,"Beloved children, Today I address, with love and mercy, all of the members of all of the cenacles of the world. Today I come like a Father of love and mercy. This is My essence, My nature. For love and mercy, I gave myself up on the Cross; for love and mercy I continuously come to all of you. Children, I find so much fear in the hearts of some as a result of the repeated phrases from those who communicate my messages to humanity. As Father, I do not announce so as to cause fear, but rather for your good, for the good of souls. Today once again I come to you with My hands and My Heart full of abundant love. How many times I have called you to prepare yourselves with all that is necessary to face the events that will come with the fulfilment of the prophecies! But today you must recognize that some are still not prepared. I have exhausted time; I have greatly shortened it; everything has infinitely accelerated for your good and yet you still wait for the last moment; it should not be so. You should live today as though it were the last day; you should live this moment as if it were the last opportunity for salvation; you should live in the state of grace; you should continually seek out the Sacrament of Reconciliation in which I give Myself to you, if you are repentant when you turn to Me. Look for Me; I am Mercy! Some remain in sin, they forget that the body is the Temple of My Holy Spirit, and on occasions they love more with human love than with Divine Love. Do not expose yourselves to human temptations because you will fall. You know that I love you and that I suffer when My Children expose themselves to temptation and human pleasure. Today I call you to renew that examination of conscience to which I have previously called you. Do not continue to fall in sin in order to please the body; do not do it because My Heart hurts enormously. It is necessary that you seek a spiritual affection; it is necessary that you fight every day to ascend spiritually. You no longer belong to this world. You are in the world, but do not allow it to entangle you with its seductions and its useless and vain pleasures. I offer you a Kingdom; I offer you peace, tranquillity, love and although you do not see Me in the human way, I live and dwell in every one and fight, fight continually to maintain you at My side. From King, I come as Beggar of love, and each one will know if I refer to him/her or not. I appeal to the human heart with My mercy, turn to your feelings and to that which I have constantly planted in you. To you I say that I love you, that I love you more than any human being can love you, that I offer you a love that transcends the earthly, a love that is infinite, a love that does not end, but a love that cannot offer you what an earthly love offers you, I offer you Paradise, I offer you eternal life, I offer you My Cross, My nails, My Crown of thorns. Love me thus, love me thus soul, love me like this! Day to day I accompany you and I have been preparing you for what is to come. And you have prepared yourselves how I mentioned to you, but that preparation has yet to conclude, but today I come to cry out for that preparation that you have not finished, ‘that spiritual preparation’. There are still some who are a stumbling stone for their brothers because they impose themselves with their character, with their desire to maintain, according to them, order around them and they have neglected the order of a house, of a dwelling that is more important, the soul. I do not want more, nor shall I permit more disagreements between brothers. Give in, give in however much is necessary to achieve and maintain peace between brothers. You talk so much about the warning, so much about the punishments, but do you know what I am going to examine you on at that moment, on what I am going to examine you? ON LOVE. Each one will have before him/her the faults of love committed against his/her fellow man, you cannot love Me without loving others; I will come to examine you on that, on love, from the lack of love derive all sins. You have turned to the Sacrament of Reconciliation; you have turned to seeking out My priests and have declared and confessed with sorrow and extreme repentance your sins and these have been forgiven and I do not contradict Myself. That is why I come, because I do not act without warning. And once again I call you to correct, all that may go against love, all that may go against love, against My teachings. So many years have we walked together! And yet you still fear those events that may take place or that will take place? You fear that? You fear those more than to continue in a state of sin. No! Fear yourselves, your interior, that egotism, that vainglory, the judgment you have committed unjustly against some brother. Fear the occasions on which you have unjustly signalled out a brother. Fear those occasions on which you have denied love to a brother, a comforting word, a smile, an embrace; fear yourselves. How many occasions have you imposed your desires, with a power to command that has been exaggerated and unjust? Fear yourselves, the occasions on which you have misused the gift of speech, using it to sink or kill the honour or the esteem of a brother, fear that ego which you have tried, one way or another, to annihilate and still on occasions prevails in you. Why distress yourselves? Because conscience tells to the creature that it is not properly prepared to face whatever it must with faith. Yes, do not fear the fulfilment of the prophecies because it is an act of love and mercy on My part. Fear yourselves, that which is within you and wants to excel and prevail. Fear that, do not fear Me, I do not come to punish you, I come to love and console you, I come to protect you because my faithful will be protected wherever they are, I will not hand you over into clutches of the enemy. It is Man who punishes himself and allows himself fall into the hands of evil. I am mercy; I am love. Do you perhaps not see My wounded hands, do you perhaps not see My crossed feet, do you perhaps not see My wounded side and shoulder, hurt from love, from mercy, hurt from aid for you, hurt of a desire to be corresponded? Why fear what will come if you are at peace with Me? Prepare yourselves and leave the rest to Me. You worry so much about your families? Leave that to Me, leave that to Me. I will take care of My own. I will take care of My faithful. Take care to grow, take care to grow in love, so that you may be a living testimony of My Love and your brothers change because of that love from you. Do not oppress yourselves thinking about the day and the date; they are My Father’s plan, live each day as if it were the last. I have already announced all of the necessary signs. I have talked to you on repeated occasions so that no one deceives you. Why are you afraid, if I love you and will protect you? I am not a God of contradiction, I am a God of love, I am a God that says yes, yes or no, no. Remain in My peace! Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,2,0,Holy Mary,February,"Beloved children, today this Mother addresses you to remind you again that nature has fused itself with the Will of the Holy Trinity. Nature lives in agreement with the Sacrosanct Trinity and before the events take place, nature will announce what comes. Maintain the peace of God in your hearts, the rest shall be added unto you. Your Holy Mother.",,,,,,,
2009,3,0,Jesus Christ,March,"Today I am spreading over with blessing, with rejoicing, with generosity, and mercy. As of today, I open My Mercy in a special way during this season of Lent, a time of mercy for all those who seek out the Sacrament of Reconciliation. I am giving humanity a great blessing, but I leave you a task, my faithful, Evangelize, ‘go and preach my Gospel’. Evangelize, my children, so that in these days your brothers will be motivated by your testimony to seek Me out in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Have the security that My Love exceeds all human love and My Mercy is infinite. I came for the sick, I came to heal, to bring you a coffer to preserve you from harm, the coffer of the Immaculate Heart of My Blessed Mother. Submerge yourselves in it because you are My Treasure. I know that you have endured difficult moments, those of which we will not discuss today. What is done is done. You must look to the present and live this moment, in which the fidelity of My own prevails, in which you are obedient and persevering. You need to resurrect spiritually being new creatures. There is fear today because of all that is happening, but you have human fear and I desire a different fear, the fear of losing Our fusion. Not a fear of punishment, or what is coming, or of the three days of darkness because if the heart is at peace, the soul is at peace, you will not see darkness; you will see and give the light of My Love. Do not be afraid due to what they tell you because in My faithful there will be no despair, no mortification; there will be light, there will be peace and love. You must be conscious of the need to separate yourselves from sin, and you must live in a state of grace. I have called you to change your bad inclinations, but you have not destroyed them yet. And you are repeatedly called by My Mother to destroy them for the sake of love, because what you have done until today, is repress the bad inclinations, and the act of repressing distances you from My Spirit, because you are not being truthful. You have to remove and annihilate the bad inclinations and destroy them for love’s sake, not repress them; because what is repressed, at some point it cannot be contained and comes out, causing more harm than was expected. You can be fearful, yes! But be fearful for the sake of love, not for punishment’s sake, because this stops growth. Fear of punishment is a stop in the way. You need to have fear of offending Me, but for love, a fear of distancing yourselves from Me, of separating yourselves from Me. Because there are two loves, mundane love and love for Me, and you must choose, you cannot live being lukewarm. I do not enter mundane love and I ask that you love Me in all that is created, find the essence of My love in all created and that is how you will truly love Me. That which you love on earth more than Me, will make your wings heavy, and that will prevent you from ascending; do not cling to the things of the world, but rather ask Me for strength to continue because here you are pilgrims; you are passing through. Beloved of Mine, seek Me with all your heart; meditate on My precepts with hope, seek for Me with all your heart, do not consider yourselves to be without blame because you will be fooling yourselves, children; look with eagerness for the gold of My Love. The one who finds love, finds treasure. Do not work hard to acquire gifts, strive in love, and the rest will be given unto you. Children, do not gauge time with human measurement; since a minute can be five years and five years can be one day; do not measure the human way because it will seem interminable to you. Abandon yourself, to My Mercy, do not cling to today because today will be a memory tomorrow. Yesterday is a memory today, and today will be a memory tomorrow. Who is the eternal present? So, live today correctly, act correctly so that what you do today, will be a blessing for tomorrow and the wrong you commit, confess it immediately, do not wait. Seek Me out immediately. Beloved, live each moment with patience because patience carries with it penance and the one who is patient knows how to do penance and the one who knows how to do penance has peace because he offers up everything. All the good that you do, adds to the treasure each one of you has in My House. Every act of mercy, every act of love, everything is kept in a spiritual bank and you accumulate wealth; you do not see this treasure but no one can take it or steal it from you. I protect you that is why I came first as a humble King, then I demonstrated my majesty on the Cross, and the glory of My Father at My Resurrection, then I will come as Judge. First, I came to reunite, and later I will come to separate the wheat from the weeds. Children, I desire that you evangelize, by means of the love towards your fellow man; but why do you stop? For lack of humility. For the tree does not grow before taking root, it does not deepen before taking root. Likewise, you have to deepen in Our union and be humble before taking root. The times are not easy, but if you have My Love before you and fully trust in My Mercy, you will have nothing to fear; My Spirit will guide you and as faithful children you will remain in the Maternal bosom. Remain in My Peace. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,3,15,Jesus Christ,March,"My beloved people, this is what our house is anxious for, prayer and the giving of yourselves in spirit and truth. Today I call you to not pay attention to the problems, to the coming events, to the tribulations especially those in the family. Are you not united to My Cross that you desire to live without tribulation, in your families or in your lives? Have you forgotten that if any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. Only ask me to help you carry it in order to lighten the weight, but do not complain so much about what you must bear, for if you look around you there are other brothers and sisters who are truly continuously afflicted. Give thanks because you have reasons to pray to Me, give thanks for this, because you are not like the majority of your brothers that live day after day in the middle of endless gibberish that makes them forget I exist. Come closer to me. My crucified, but glorious Hand is extended before each one of My children, to grasp them strongly and take them out of the mud; no matter how soiled a child may be, I will not leave him. All are worthy to enter in My House, I only wait for a word, I only wait for a Lord help me, be near me, listen to me, forgive me! and I go immediately to give aid. As soiled as a child may be, how can I leave him abandoned? If for those sinners I gave Myself up on a cross, on My Cross of Love, of sacrifice, of giving, on My Cross of glory to rescue all, because I do not desire that a single one of Mine be lost. Come to My Mercy, come to My Mercy. This moment is a moment of prayer, of complete surrender to God and sacrifice; and those who live submerged in My Mercy know perfectly of what I am talking about at this moment. It is a time of prayer for My Church, for My Peter, for the attacks of those who prowl around the Throne of My Peter. I need the prayers of my faithful, the prayers of those souls who are sincere, of those that give themselves to me. I need the prayers of My Church ‘to pray precisely for itself’. A prayerful Church is a victorious, triumphant Church. Today more than at another time, all those who call themselves Christians must pray with zeal, with tenacity, and offer sacrifices, fasts, and unite themselves as one, without reservations. Children, there are those who in one country or another, in one continent or another, in the entire world, who look for how to usurp My temples in order to commit sacrileges and in that way cause pain to My Heart. You must be brave so as to profess your faith; you must not be silent; you must proclaim your faith. You look for a thousand ways in which to come closer to Me; and there is a key, it is the master key that opens the door to My House, that opens the spiritual door for you so that you come closer to Me, this key is love. Today I call you, My beloved people, My beloved and faithful Church to be united in love, not to demolish yourselves as is the custom of some today, as if it were the cutting of trees, so they do with their brothers; I give you this example because just as today you deforest My nature, My creation, today many are deforesting My Church to dry her up, to leave her arid, to dry up the fountain of My Love and of My Mercy before humanity, but it is not so, my fountain of love and mercy is inexhaustible and is for everyone, for everyone. I call you My beloved children, to love one another, to be a single heart of love in the heart of My Blessed Mother and in My Heart. Do not use, under any circumstance, the gift of speech to destroy the honour, the prestige and the dignity of a brother or sister. There is nothing more painful that pierces so much My Mother’s heart and My Heart than to hear many who almost live in My temples, helping My ministers and spending hours on their knees, and later I hear them using their tongue as a double-edged sword against their own brothers and sisters. You My Church do not do it! My faithful use the gift of speech to love and not to hurt, to exalt the virtues of your brothers not to destroy the dignity of many innocents. And those who you do not believe to be innocent, leave that judgment to Me, for the one who believes himself to be wise, before Me is not so wise, because I am infinite Wisdom. The one who believes he is very faithful, perhaps is not so faithful because he is giving death to a brother or sister with his tongue using it as a ‘double-edged sword’. The one who believes himself to be patient ceases to be patient when he says that he is patient. The one who believes himself to be light, ceases to receive My light when he says he is light. That is why I call you so much to humility, the one who is humble knows what he possesses and since he knows, he does not have to shout it to the world because like Me, he knows to be silent, recognizing that there is Someone greater who will speak for him. I have never left my Church alone, read the Scripture. I have always helped My people at every moment and now, why do you put Me before all of humanity as an unmerciful castigating God, if I have never, never abandoned My people and I will never do it at this time? I am before each one of you; come to receive Me, come to adore Me, come to Me, I am in you, I am Love, I am Mercy, for you I gave Myself up, for you I resurrected, for you I have come to call you to unity and love, so that as of today you call your brothers and sisters to a universal chain of prayer for my church, for all of my beloved, my priests and religious, for all the faithful laypeople so that their faith and commitment grows more each day and they resemble my mother that kept everything in the silence of her heart. Give love and at every moment know how to be worthy witnesses and testimonies of your Jesus. Call for a chain of prayer for my peter, who is being attacked by those who desire to usurp what does not belong to man, a world-wide chain of prayer for all those who submerged in sin sink themselves more and more, so that they turn their gaze to me, because I am anxiously waiting to embrace them. Remain in My peace, I bless you. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,4,0,Jesus Christ,April,"My beloved people, As the ‘Holy Week’ approaches I desire to call all of human kind to conversion once again, I call you to turn to the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Do not be afraid to confess the sins you have committed for I Myself am there before you, giving you, My forgiveness. My Mercy is infinite. No matter how grave a committed sin may be, if your repentance is heartfelt and you make a firm resolution to never commit it again, I forgive you because My Mercy is infinite. But since man possesses free will to do and act, I as Lord of Love, respect that freedom and wait for man to come to Me, soliciting forgiveness with a contrite and humble heart, and I, with My hands full of love and my merciful heart, will forgive him, I will always forgive him. I wait even until the final moment of life to forgive what the child solicits Me to forgive. I make a call to all my beloved priests so that they do not lead astray the sheep from the flock, I do not call them to allow sins that should not be allowed, I call them to be more loving, to know how to advise and to lead souls so that they turn away from sin and come closer to Me, to make them conscious that living in peace and away from sin, gives an infinite peace. And all that occurs day to day in the elapse of life, changes colour, like the song says ‘de colores, de colores’; depending on the state of the soul, that is the colour with which one views the daily events of life. I do not punish, I am love. You, my beloved, punish yourselves. How is it possible that you deny so many things nowadays in order to give greater freedom to My children, instead of reaffirming what is written in Scripture? My beloved people, my house exists! Yes, it exists! Heaven exists, so much that I resurrected and dwell at My Father’s side in the Unity of our Holy Spirit. Yes, Heaven exists, it exists for those who repent, for those who live their lives serving Me, praying, loving Me, helping and loving their fellow man, fulfilling the established commandments, the sacraments, fulfilling the acts of mercy, fulfilling what is written in the Sacred Scripture. Yes, Heaven exists, so much that I have prepared a table where I will seat My chosen ones, my faithful, those that by free will have chosen to live a just life, those that, at whatever moment of their lives, have repented and will repent whole heartedly, ‘in spirit and truth’. But for those who today are denying the existence of a place of suffering after death for those who have not lived a life united with Me, I must tell them that punishment does exist for those who deny themselves salvation. I am not a god that punishes, I am not a merciless god, my mercy is infinite, but man punishes himself and after leaving the earth continues to suffer for the sins he committed. Yes, a place of suffering exists, and you should not deny it since heaven exists and I dwell there, there also exists a place of suffering, for those who have lived all their life sunk in sin and have never, never repented. I wait even until the last moment, my heart and my love are infinite, and the last instant, the last breath of life is for me the opportunity to give my infinite mercy to my children. My Mother continuously intercedes for each one of my children. She the ‘full of grace’, the one who during this Holy Week dresses her heart in mourning once again in commemoration of My complete surrender, My passion and My love. It pains her to see how you deny the existence of My House and how you deny the existence of a place of suffering that man creates for himself, since by denying the suffering for the sins that have been committed, you are denying My Cross, and whoever denies My Cross, does not know Me, does not love Me, whoever denies My Cross, does not love Me, does not recognize Me and when he calls Me Father, when he calls me: Lord! Lord! He lies, because he denies what is most great, he denies the symbol of My infinite love, he denies the symbol of My infinite surrender, which is My Cross, that tree which I embraced with love, which I embraced and on which I suffered for each one of you. That is why today I call you to recognize in my cross. My love, My surrender, My sacrifice, but also, My infinite Mercy for each one of you. You are My most precious jewels. For each one of you, you who listen and read this word of Mine, for you beloved child, for you I gave myself up on the cross, and for you I wait in the sacrament of reconciliation to forgive you and to welcome you, so that you may be reunited with me and I may love you with all of my divine love. I invite you to love one another, as I have loved you, since whoever loves Me and does not love his fellow man, does not love Me. There is one condition in My love, and it is this: ‘love your neighbour as yourself’. I call you, beloved children, to live this Holy Week in holiness, in withdrawal, offering and praying, not in the midst of noise, or in the midst of pleasure, not in the midst of lust, not in the midst of alcoholism and drug addiction, not in the midst of sex; these are the false gods of today, but I am the God of yesterday, of today and always, I am God of eternity. Life is fleeting, I offer you eternal life, take it, accept it, eternal life, eternal happiness, eternal joy. Life does not end here, it is merely a step towards eternal life, towards the happiness that you will not know here, I wait for you in My House, come closer to Me! During this Holy Week, look for the one who is most in need, look for that hungry man in the street, for I am there, and give him food and drink. I am in the needy, I am in the suffering, I am in the sick, I am in all my children and you My beloved people, should not forget the abandoned and the destitute. Unite yourselves into a single heart of prayer, during this holy week. Make amends for all those who, not desiring to come closer to Me, offend Me. Make amends for all those who, not desiring to come closer to Me, despise Me. Make amends for the forgetfulness of some of your brothers and sisters, in this ‘Magna Week’, and do not forget that heaven does exist, there also exists the suffering that man forges for himself, because many say: ‘we are all saved’, and yes, all are saved, I have saved you on My Cross, I suffered for the sins of all of you but whoever does not repent, whoever does not recognize his or her sin, does not enjoy My House and not by My cause but because man himself punishes himself with his free will. How much My heart desires to have all enjoying of My banquet, but not all want to accept Me! Instead, so many, so many offend Me, even those who are closest to Me, serving Me. Because of that make repair, love, offer, confess your sins for I forgive you because I love all. And for that most hardened sinner, for that one I suffer the most. I call you to come closer to me, time is passing and you should not wait until the last moment to repent. Enjoy living in peace and tranquillity, of being able to see all that occurs with faith, with love in Me, with tranquillity, with patience and humility, but only those who live close to Me will obtain this, the ones who do not live close to Me, despair and fall without getting up, they drown in desperation. That is why I call you with time to repent, to turn your gaze to Me, time is passing, do not let it go. Remember that today forms tomorrow and yesterday forged today, if yesterday you sinned, repent today, for your tomorrow will be better it will be a tomorrow of blessings. The one who sinned yesterday and recognizes his or her sin and continues sunken in sin, his or her tomorrow will not be one of blessings. Repent, so that tomorrow may be a tomorrow of blessing! I have never abandoned My own. My Mother is before each one of you, interceding, turn to Her, turn to Her so that she may take you by the hand and it is easier for you to leave behind those attractions of the world of today and which day to day sink man in sin. How much sin the television brings to homes! How much sin is inculcated in the little ones when instead of sitting them on laps, looking them in the eyes, hugging them and telling them ‘I love you’, the modern parents sit them in front of a father and a mother who continuously make them watch sexual messages, messages of death, messages of destruction, messages of a false power, and they keep leading them in this manner until they form children, adolescents, young people and adults, full of falsity, of hate, of lack of affection and willing to deceive their fellow man but above all themselves, disguising all of their frustrations with the false modern gods. I make a call so that in your homes you control, during this Holy Week and the rest of your lives, that medium of communication that is destroying the life of the innocents through programs that are continuously transmitted. For the commercials are a joke, an offense against Me, all of them lead to sin and are forming in the mind of the human being, a king: ‘sin’. You are conscious of it and as faithful children of Mine; you should make an effort with respect to this in order to control whatever is watched in your homes; do not allow the minds of the innocents to become deformed each day. Oh! What great blame falls on those that allow, perhaps to rest and evade a little bit the responsibility of being fathers and mothers, that their children submerge themselves in what are called advanced technologies that only bring fighting and death. That is why there is so much murder, that is why so many of my children take their life because now those advanced technological games have made children and the youth believe that life and death are powers of man; that giving death signifies nothing; the despising of life causes My Heart a great pain. In Gethsemane I sweated blood and wept blood because the sins of this age passed before Me. To you who reads this message today, I say: your Jesus suffered for you, sweated blood for you in Gethsemane, for your sins, but for your sins I gave Myself up because I love you. Come to me, cease sinning today for I am with My Hands, My Arms and My Heart open to embrace you when you decide to call me: lord! Lord! Forgive me! And I will say to you: ‘come child, come for my love is infinite, come to my house to partake of my joy in me’. Remain in My peace, I love you! Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,4,0,Holy Mary,April,"Dearly beloved children, I come today, as the Sorrowful Mother, to call all of humanity in this Holy Week, to live this Holy Week with intensity since it represents the culmination of the Divine Love. I come to call you today to be that different note, that light that ignites in the midst of a human race that enjoys a week of pleasure and rest. You, as true Christians, should be that light of offering, of love, of sanctity that causes that the Trinitarian Gaze turns to humankind. Prayer is extremely powerful, and still more powerful is the prayer of those who, with a humble heart, love, supplicate, and offer everything to God. As the Sorrowful Mother who accompanied Her Son during all of His Passion, I come to accompany all of you; all of you are My children and I love you all. All remain absolutely within My Heart; I protect you all with My Mantle and I intercede for all before My Son. I desire that you be that different note that retakes a little bit the tradition of the respect that was observed in the past for this Holy Week. Be that offering of love towards My Son that repairs humanity’s sin. Be the ones who accompany Me like true children of God during all of these days that commemorate the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of My Son, so that in that Resurrection, you as new and true children, continue the rest of your life, to be light in the path of all those who come near you. I love you and call you again this week to fast, to offer, to pray and to make reparation for your sins. Attend the liturgical celebrations and live them with intensity of love. Feel them in your heart, in your flesh, and in your being. Commemorate the greatest offering of divine love, live step by step at my son’s side, for I, as mother of sorrow and of love, remain beside you protecting you. Do not be frightened by those messages that go around the world and fill My children with terror and fright. Centre your life, centre your walking, centre your mind on keeping the commandments, the mandates of the Holy Mother Church, the rest will be given unto you. The one who is love, lives on love, is nourished by love, is fed by love and does not fear what surrounds him, or what can make him lose eternal life. You are heroes, heroes that battle day to day to keep themselves united to My Son; that is why you should live with the security, the firmness and the faith that He will never abandon you. My Son gave Himself up for you, He lives for each one of you and is waiting for you with open arms. Maintain your hearts full of love, transpire love towards your brothers and sisters, towards all that surrounds you. I love you My children, live always in My Son’s love, trusting in His Infinite Mercy. Your Sorrowful Mother.",,,,,,,
2009,5,0,Holy Mary,May,"Children of my immaculate heart, Today I call you once again to pray, united by humanity’s needs, and I call you in a special way to accompany the Supreme Pontiff through prayer. Children, you are facing difficult times; you should not forget that no matter how trying these times may be, My Hand is always protecting you. I constantly intercede for you, my beloved, before the Trinitarian Throne. Every dawn is a new day, in which you should fight to remain united to My Son, being faithful and living in unity, respecting one another and interceding for each other. Unity is important. You should persevere in this. That is how the true faithful are distinguished. This is a special moment and I invite you to unite yourselves in a single voice of prayer, call your brothers and sisters to pray the Holy Rosary and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy with the intention of crying out to the Paternal House so that all that is afflicting humanity may be banished from the earth. Beloved children of My Heart, overwhelm all of creation with love by being those children that cry out with righteous intentions for all of their brothers and sisters, be those souls that offer up every moment of their life, for love of My Son. Live in a different way than the world, that the virtues that you possess, given by the Holy Spirit, arise constantly in you, so that this be a school for your brother and sisters, the manner of communicating, of conversing, of sharing, of expressing yourselves, of loving your neighbour, that it be a lesson for your peers of what each of My children carries on the inside, that it is nothing other than the love of My Son. I know well My beloved, that on occasion the fatigue from the daily struggle oppresses you, but do not give in at any moment. Be at every moment, true children, do not let yourselves be seduced by evil, remain alert in prayer, so that evil does not confuse you. Today I call everyone to remain within the Church that My Son founded, do not let yourselves be confused by false prophets that attempt against My faithful Supreme Pontiff, Benedict XVI. Beloved, today just as humanity is facing a new illness, it will face others that are born from man himself, and from his desire for power. You should pray to keep the wall standing, which is a force of good, and in that way, with everyone united, strengthen all of creation, and therefore also strengthen man. Do not think about those who do not heed My calls, maintain yourselves firm in a battle stance, but a battle of love, since love conquers all, a love for God and neighbour. That is the reason for which I have summoned you to remain alert in continuous messages from this, your Mother, to be conscious of the value of the sacramentals, but above all of the immense value of a being in the state of grace, a human being who lives on the Love of his Lord and transmits it to his brothers and sisters. I bless you, remain in My Heart. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,5,0,Jesus Christ,May,"My beloved people, I bless you, I remain in you; My Mother protects you and covers you with Her Mantle. Once again, I call you to live united with Me, not forgetting that who lives in Me, continues loving me and loving his/her neighbour. I call you to be copies of My Merciful Love, having present, very present love, mercy, and understanding towards your neighbour at all times. Be patient as I am patient; forgive as I forgive, so that in the same way, you may be forgiven. Beloved, My Love is a constant excess, it has called you to remain alert in the face of the events that humanity faces, those of which are the fulfilment of what was previously announced, not forgetting My Mercy, which remains on all those who cry out to Me. My children’s faith surpasses the events; I have never forgotten My people. I dwell in all those who call Me; I will go quickly to their aid. Unite yourselves in a single voice of prayer that cries out for divine assistance. Do not forget that the power of prayer is infinite, and this is truly a wall that holds back all that threatens humanity if it is offered in a state of grace. I invite you not to forget the use of sacramentals. In case of contagious diseases (pestilences, plagues, others) anoint the doors and windows with holy oil. If you find yourselves sick, sprinkle the food with holy water and keep in mind the use of the medicinal plants My Mother has indicated you use for these unexpected circumstances. Be people firm in faith, knowing that being endowed with reason and intelligence, you consciously obey the guidelines that the leaders of your countries indicate to you. My call is to remain alert. In this moment, humanity is threatened by illness. So, at this time, you should protect and help one another with authentic love and with mercy, caring for your brothers and sisters as much as is possible, in the same way that you care for yourselves, and remain in your homes when your countries are being threatened by some epidemic. Do not forget that My Glorious Cross is a sign for My faithful. Remain in My Mercy and protected by the Mantle of My Mother, not forgetting that solidarity is a standard of those who are Mine. Nourish the spirit through faith and try to store food to sustain the body. I have called you in the past to live apart from the world and the worldly; today I remind you of this call which is no other than the call of My very Love. I bless you. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,5,0,Jesus Christ,May,"Beloved children, I bless you; you are my treasure. ‘To you child, it is to you I speak today; it is to you I call; it is you to whom I offer My Heart, so that you may take refuge in it and find all that you are looking for. I offer you eternal salvation; I only ask for your commitment and your fidelity. You are My people, and you should live in a fraternal community, guided by My Spirit, without divisions, or disputes, so that you give true testimony of My Love. Today more than ever I call you to live in fraternity, fortifying one another through faith, nourishing yourselves daily by My Body and My Blood so that you continue with the necessary strength and do not fall along the way. Today man is thirsty; he wanders in search of what he lacks; ‘he lacks My Love,’ not because I deny it to him, but rather because even though I remain before him, man does not recognize Me, does not pay attention to Me. Be docile. Let yourselves be shaped by My Love, like clay in My Hands. Clay is weak; man is weak and should humbly accept that, recognizing his limitations. If he abandons himself in My Hands, he will live covered by My Mercy. Whoever lives covered by My Mercy, is in the same way merciful with his/her brothers and sisters, and this is what humanity is lacking. Children, be those springs in which the thirsty find crystalline water that satiates their thirst; be understanding, be comfort, be mercy, but above all, be love, that ingredient which is lacking so that everything changes and humanity no longer remains in darkness. Children, today many allurements are offered to deceive you, and little by little separate you from the correct path without you noticing it. This is the reason for which I call you again and again to remain alert, so that you do not fall into error and you do not stray from My commandments. The mundane walks slyly in the midst of those who are Mine; presenting sin as something normal disguised by good actions; that is why I invite you to invoke My Holy Spirit to illuminate you, to comfort you, and to give you the necessary and indispensable discernment, so that you may confront and bravely defeat the modernisms that make My Heart bleed and that desire to undermine My Church through My People’s libertinism. Today I call you to be grateful with one another. The one who is grateful has his heart clean and overwhelmed with love, whoever is thankful is the one who is overly abundant with love, because he knows how to receive and give with a pure heart. The Christian is distinguished at all times because he acts in My way, responds in My way, is a child that lives in the midst of the world without the world wrapping him in its ways and extravagances. Thank those who make you grow spiritually, those who help you in your needs. My Mother gives this lesson of gratefulness, she gives thanks to My Heavenly Father, she gives thanks to the Archangel Gabriel, to My Father Joseph, to the shepherds, to the wise men, to Simeon, to those who accompanied her on the way to Calvary, she gives thanks to John; in that way her life is a continual act of thanksgiving to My Father in the name of all her children. Beloved children, give thanks and remain faithful to My church, be obedient so that unity prevents divisions. Unity is strength and strength are an impenetrable wall; prayer is the flag that unites My people in a single voice that ascends to My House, the incense of the greatest value; each prayer is a light that illuminates the world and banishes darkness. Humanity holds a weapon in its hands: ‘Prayer’. It should make use of it and come to know the blessing it receives with it; the importance of praying for one another is a blessing for those who offer it with love. Be light, and salt of the earth, light is not hidden, salt seasons; in the same way My children are not here to go unnoticed but rather to intercede for all that afflicts humanity. Be united, be one heart that beats in a single prayer for all of the necessities that all nations are facing at this moment. If, at this moment, you are not suffering from nature’s attacks, from diseases, or from hunger, do not be indifferent toward those that are suffering, since no nation can assure it will not suffer these calamities at some moment. The cold-heartedness and indifference before suffering is an example of the estrangement that man maintains with My House. The Christian accompanies, suffers, and rejoices with his neighbour, because he knows that a neighbour is the image and likeness of his Creator. Palpitate in one heart of love and solidarity with the Chaplet of My Divine Mercy and the Holy Rosary, especially in this month dedicated to My Mother. She is the ark on which those who desire to remain safe and protected from what is coming should board. Be one, be love, the Christian is a person of faith, faith is life and life is love. Remain in My Peace. Your Jesus. Prayer: ‘Immaculate Mother, blessed Sanctuary of love, To You do we cry, hear our pleas, we implore Your Maternal intercession at this moment. In which the scourge of illness threatens humanity. You, faithful protector of those who humbly come to ask for Your favours, pray to the Holy Trinity to send Its angelic protectors to combat this evil that befalls those who belong to You. May Your Holy Mantle be shield and shelter for all of us who faithfully ask this favour, so that out towns and homes be sealed by the Celestial protection. We give you thanks Immaculate Mother for so great a favour; Do not abandon us in this valley of tears, you are shield, shelter and guide of those of us who cry out in one voice’. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2009,5,18,Jesus Christ,May,"Beloved children, receive my blessing, this is the moment in which this, my word, should be spread to all of humanity through my daughter. You already know enough about the false prophets, who desire to cause terror among those who belong to Me, presenting Me only as a God of punishment and not of Mercy, with the purpose of distancing My people from Me and causing discord in My Church; the Church that at this moment is suffering persecution, that is being signalled out, that is being attacked by the mass media, behind which men of little faith take advantage of the technological advancements to bombard again and again, especially, the mind of the youth, dragging them away from Me and leading them to live in sin. Children it is urgent that each one of you dedicates himself/herself to prayer. Only through prayer will you continue to be those lights that give life to Creation. Today darkness spreads quickly over humanity, overwhelming the minds of My people with hate and liberalism; they rebel, and without realizing the evil they are causing, they themselves are on their way to becoming the next persecutors of My faithful. At the beginning, when the earth was chaos, confusion, and darkness, light came to separate and dissipate darkness. Today each one of you, those who listen to My calls, those who are faithful, those who remain under My Mother’s Mantle, are the light that maintains what is created, in union with My House. My constant calls and those of My Mother are dedicated to the unity of those who remain faithful. They are a call to offer yourselves as living Host of reparation, in the name of all of humanity. You are a community of love, and continually are born to life, in each offering, in each surrender, against the negativity of those who reject My Love and undermine My Church. Children you are those lamps that should never become extinguished, no matter how strong the winds may blow, since you participate in My Light, now communicate it with love, and wisdom. I have given you an infinite and great gift, by being carriers of light. But in this moment, there is so much darkness in man; that is the reason for which I call you to be not only prudent, but even more, wise, so that you do not stagger, you should be constant and not be those lamps that burn and go out. They burn when all that occurs is favourable, but they go out when the events are not to their liking. Today you must be brave. With the necessary courage to know that faith is not something that one puts on or takes off at will; faith is ‘life.’ Today I summon you to unity, to maintain a pure heart, to live according to My teachings, to be witnesses of My Love and Mercy, this is the time of those who are lukewarm, who let themselves be easily dragged, but at the same time, this is the time of My faithful, who, through unity, make up that impenetrable wall that has kept My Mystic Body standing throughout the ages. Beloved of my heart, I invite you to unify prayer in reparation for so much harm that man himself causes to himself and to My Creation, the indifference with which man sees life is heartrending, the spiritual decay and the ease with which man finds how to explain, in his way, what he does not have or cannot explain is frightful, hate hovers over My people, the indifference at the suffering of a brother and sister, is a product of the estrangement of ‘man with his Lord and God,’ that is the reason for which you must reinforce and fortify your internal life, so that the suffering before such atrocities does not lead you to fall and drive you away from this, your Jesus, who loves you. Today I come to each one of you, my faithful, to offer you once again My Heart so you may take refuge in it, and find peace, love, comfort, strength, when you need them, I remain attentive to your pleas, I constantly maintain you under My gaze. This is the moment in which you should ask with tenacity for my Holy Spirit so that under His protection, you discern and maintain yourselves firm and fortified, time is difficult, it passes quickly, so much so that if you wrap yourselves up in it, you will fall into dejection. From there, the indispensability of prayer, of daily assistance to the Eucharistic Celebration to receive Me, of practicing in spirit and truth love towards God and neighbour, of forgiving, and above all, of maintaining internal peace. My children, do not be reason for scandal; be living testimonies, models of holiness, be light for your brothers and sisters, do not be death, be life. I feel so much pain at seeing some of My children rambling through life like corpses; even though on the outside they sing and laugh, on the inside they are empty, without God! It is to you, those who call themselves My children, to whom I come today, to convoke you to unity, to prayer with a single heart. Only in that way, in a single heart, will My Church resist the continuous attacks of evil; and that one heart is the Immaculate Heart of My Mother, the Ark of the New Covenant, support of My faithful. That unity will be heard through all of creation, through the praying of the Holy Rosary and imploring mercy through the Divine Mercy Chaplet, that is how My people should cry out today, that is how My faithful people should intercede today. I call you to be free and what greater freedom than to offer oneself and sacrifice oneself for one’s brothers and sisters? What greater freedom than to live in holiness? What greater freedom than to banish personal egotism? What greater freedom than to be free of oneself, of one’s egoism? Child, be free and come to me, I your Jesus, love you and I wait for you, to shelter you in my heart. Have my heart, I offer it you, take it… your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,5,25,Holy Mary,May,"Beloved children of My Heart. Today, especially, I call you to reinforce personal prayer. Pray vigorously, asking the Almighty for the fullness of His Holy Spirit, so that guided at all times you may be true testimonies of Christian love. He who does not love his neighbour cannot call himself a Christian; you cannot say you love God, if you do not love your brothers and sisters. Nowadays man loves himself and creates for himself a love towards God independent of the love for his brother and sister; and this, my beloved children, is not possible. Man is the image and likeness of God, Triune, Three in One; and it is that image and likeness that is in each one of you. Although you may not know one another, everyone forms part of one Spirit that calls you to be unity, to live in communion. Today more than at any other moment of the history of mankind, man as son of God, has the duty of forming part of ‘a single heart’; the coming times are not easy; and My children know this well. Man’s independence towards his Creator has opened the door to events already announced, that you awaited for in later times. In this estrangement, man feeling self-sufficient and even more, ‘creator’, has accelerated for himself, pain; carrying calamities that he will not be able to control; man has unleashed the forces of nature upon himself. Pain is repeatedly lived around the globe, and even so you continue waiting for more signs on the proximity of all that Divine Mercy, has been announced around the world by this your Mother. Do not let reason betray you, giving explanations of what you cannot explain with human words, prepare yourselves. Children, today I invite you to prepare yourselves, but above all spiritually. My Son is waiting for you, do not resist His call. Love one another. Only in that way, united in true communion, will you defeat the forces of evil that slyly prepare their battle against the faithful people. Beloved, maintain your heart united to My Son’s, so that all that takes place on earth does not drive you to decay in faith. You walk towards the goal, and this is not the time to follow human idols, one is the Word, one is the commandment, one is the Scripture, so do not allow yourselves to be drawn by modernisms that are not a part of the Trinitarian Will. I am Mother and Teacher of all, I intercede for each one of you, even for those who do not call me nor perceive me as Mother. I received everyone at the foot of the Cross. As Mother, I will guide and protect My children, in these difficult times. My Help will not be denied to anyone who asks for it. My Heart remains open at every instant, the door never closes. The unity of those who are mine is essential from now on more than at any other time, since the Church is being attacked daily by the forces of evil; man is constantly tempted, and attacked so that he forgets that God is God, and man is a child of God. Beloved, unite yourselves to this Your Mother who intercedes for each one of you. Humanity is thirsting for God, even if man himself ignores it. Today I call you to intercede for your brothers and sisters I call you to pray for all that your brothers and sisters do not pray. I call you to make reparation for the lack of love and mercy of your brothers and sisters, by being light, light that radiates Divine Love. Prepare yourselves children, so events do not cause you to stagger, but rather that at seeing beyond what the world can see, you may be the strength, the echo of the call of this Mother that cries out to be heard. I love you My children, I love you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,6,0,Holy Mary,June,"Beloved children of my heart, As Mother of all men, I bless you. Beloved, may the Holy Spirit flood you with His fire in order to burn away all that is not love and unity in your hearts. So much pain afflicts My Heart at this moment in which humanity in general runs wildly towards sin! How My Heart aches before so many disintegrated, separated families! How My Heart aches before the sunken youth, submerged in licentiousness and in drugs! How My Heart aches, pierced again and again by that dagger of the lack of affection, of that forgetfulness that God is God. Man walks in a desert, seeking to satiate his thirst in the wrong springs. How My Heart aches because of those prayers that are offered up insincerely! Children, you know well that prayer is infinite; it is that armour, that banner that all men need in order to overcome the battle at this moment. I call you from now on to intensify it with great perseverance for all of these intentions that I have enumerated, and even more for the Church, the Mystical Body that is being severely persecuted by Satan, who looks for all possible sides in which to find weakness so as to attack her mercilessly. Children, pray with the intention of uniting all times in an eternal present of love; continue being those faithful that carry torches in their hands, that offering which is elevated to the Trinitarian Throne. You are love, you possess the Divine Spirit, allow it to arise. Children, I invite you to transform each word into prayer, from now on, may the word be blessing for your brother and sister and in that way may each heart be sealed with the Love of My Son, and in His likeness may you be models of hope, commitment, faith, mercy. Live in indissoluble unity and may this be balsam for My Son’s Heart. I love you My children, I love you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,

Humanity is continuously attacked, evil throws poisonous darts, Today I ask My people to consecrate themselves to My Heart And in that way be protected in it, where nothing and no one can touch you. Children, do not forget the use of sacramentals. They offer you protection at this moment. Do not forget about holy water…use it, it is for you, it is for the protection of My People, it is blessing for My People. Beloved bless your homes, bless your bodies, bless your brothers and sisters with the Word. I bless you at this moment. Be blessing for your fellow men.

Receive, I beg You, this my consecration to You, and keep me, as of this moment, as your own possession. Amen.",,,,,,,
2009,6,25,Jesus Christ,June,"Beloved children, I call you, once again, to remain firm in faith! I call you to open your spiritual eyes so you may see beyond what the eyes of the body see. I call you to be humble, since the humble one knows well what he is made of and maintains his feet firm so that nothing or no one leads him to stray from the path, because he knows that ‘without Me you can do nothing’. My beloved children, you know well the proximity of the great events that I and My Mother announced for humanity; the nearness is easily perceived. Not only in nature, but also in facts, reactions, violence and arrogance with which man acts, ‘man turns against man.’ The instability in the world will give more violence as a consequence. Beloved, you are conscious of that which I speak to you today, but this should not cause you to despair, but rather should move you with greater persistence to the urgency of the repentance and amendment of all My people. You know that more than feeling fear at the knowledge that you possess about what is coming, these things should be urgent to you, unifying yourselves in fraternity, love for your neighbour, and above all, love yourselves remaining in My commandments so you do not fall into mortal sin or into unbelief. I call you today to be truly free of all that enslaves you and submerges you in evil. He who sins, makes himself a slave of sin. Beloved children, you know that you should not support your faith in human beings, because humans can fail, and when the foundations fail, what will the just one be able to do? ‘Man contaminates himself by what comes forth from him. ’You should build on my word, on my truth, so that you may be free. Do not forget that, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life,’ come to Me, all possess life as long as they maintain themselves united to Me. Do not forget children that he who thinks himself to be wise in these My ways, perhaps is just beginning, because life is like a tree in constant growth; therefore, you should maintain yourselves feeding on the sap of My Word so that you grow strong, and the different winds that blow around with modernist ideas and vain ideologies do not succeed in making you fall. This is the time to fit yourselves with the belt of obedience to My commandments, to obey My Peter, and to not let yourselves be taken in by those who profess a false religiousness at their convenience, to satisfy and justify their false commitment to Me. Children, I am in all, and My Spirit pours itself equally on all. Life is a gift, a celebration, ‘faith is life,’ and in life each creature seeks to share with its fellow creatures; thus, should you maintain yourselves united in My Love, and fortify My Church, without yielding to what I have not commanded. There are those today who enrage against My Church, because they know that it is in the hands of the Almighty, and they wish to undermine her foundations, and they will succeed if you My beloved, base your faith in the ‘human being.’ You know well that I call you to live against the current of the world, that is why you are My heroes, because My ways are for the brave. The lukewarm characterize themselves by growing and growing, but in the least misfortune, they let show the emptiness they carry within, not without first taking with them all who are not firm. Those who feel themselves to be satisfied and self-sufficient, do not need Me; ‘they already have it all,’ they remain on a pedestal from which they do not desire to come down, the one who believes himself to have it all, does not need his brothers and sisters, the proud and stubborn one makes himself greater even when he excels alone, until his pride makes him fall and not get up. Today I call you to know to distinguish who is clay in the hands of the Potter and lets himself be moulded to the image and likeness of His Lord, and who has his feet in mud, because he falls in the midst of a roar. My beloved children, I invite you today to be humble par excellence, the humble one is not weak; on the contrary this one matures in faith, and is precisely what I desire of each one of you. Allow Me to guide you so that you do not feel the way is impossible to travel. I am here, before each one of you, my hand remains before you, only allow Me to guide you, My Heart beats rapidly for those who are Mine, each prayer of every one of My children is incense that rises towards My House. The fidelity, the commitment, the love towards My Mother and the obedience to Her constant pleas for the whole world, is light that makes My Heart palpitate with love, and leads Me to constantly pour My Mercy throughout all of creation. You are My treasure, for you I gave Myself up, for each one of you, and not even the most sinful of all remains outside of My Mercy when he looks at Me sorrowfully and with a firm resolution of amendment. My mercy leads Me to protect My children, to maintain them in My lap, to call them to walk with the security that I will never leave them at any moment, at any moment; My Love is infinite and overcomes all that man can imagine, only remain close to Me. My mercy reaches the confines of the earth, and seeks with thirst, souls, to alleviate their pains and rescue them from the mud. When you cry out to Me, I am Light. When you have darkness, I am Sun. When you are cold, I am Love. When you feel hurt, I am Strength. For those who are persecuted because they follow Me, I am Balm. For those who are despised because they love Me, I am Life, nourishment, water, air. I am who I am. My children, there is still time, return to My fold, do not wait for the evening to fall. Here I am, I call to you, not to someone else but to you who by My Mercy have received this My Word. Here is My strength, so you make it yours, here is My Love, so you make it yours, Here I am before you. Come, Your Jesus calls you. Come to Me, child. Come to Me… Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,6,27,Holy Mary,June,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, united in the Divine Love, you are a sign of fidelity and commitment to the Will of God. Children, thus, as an evident sign of Love in the unity of one Spirit, I convoke you to pray for the Church. Each one of you is a fundamental part of the Mystical Body, and as members of that Body, you should procure to enter with eagerness into the deep knowledge of the sacred scriptures, of the commandments, of the sign and gift that each sacrament contains, of the beatitudes, of all that concerns the apostolic, Roman Catholic religion, since you cannot call yourselves adorers of My Son if you do not know him at depth; nor can you have the necessary arms to defend yourselves, if it is necessary, from the bad interpretations that some give about the doctrine that My Son left established, for the salvation of the human race. Children, each one, should walk conscious of the constant blessings that you receive from the father’s house, conscious of the Divine Mercy, that without ceasing, is in constant flight from Heaven to earth, so that all men might have the great blessing of maintaining within their reach, all the help they need to overcome the trials and attacks of each day, with spiritual health. Beloved, when the body becomes ill, you immediately seek the doctor to cure you. Today I ask you, when you sin, do you seek the sacrament of confession? Oh children, walking day to day accumulating sins, becomes a habit and this only leads you to the voluntary estrangement from God and ugliness of the soul. I call you today to wash and promptly clean your soul, turning to the Sacrament of Confession and thoroughly fulfilling the penance, since at this moment, the conscience of some of My children has hardened itself to such an extent, that in the state of mortal sin and conscious of it, they go up to receive the Body and Blood of My Divine Son. I call you to make reparation for this very great pain to which My Son’s Heart is submitted, when He is received in such conditions; that is why you should be Eyes that repair, Ears that repair, Hands that repair, Feet that repair, Thought that repairs, Heart that repairs, Make reparation for all the offenses that My Son receives; this is the reason for my call, so that you may be conscious of the gift so infinite that you have in the Sacrament of the Eucharist; be conscious of the real and true presence of my son in the eucharist. Today I call you to get up, separate yourselves from the earthly, momentary and superfluous, so that you attach yourselves to the ‘infinite truth,’ to the true happiness; I invite you to deny yourselves, with all your strength, aided by the strength of the Divine Light that you possess in your interior; My Son desires to beautify you. My beloved, you well know that man himself is generating the swiftness of the fulfilment of the great catastrophes, punishments that man has generated for himself. The persecution of My children is not far off, violence grows quickly, in the face of man so hardened by the desire to be like his Creator, and committed to pleasure in all its magnitude. This is the reason for My urgent call for you to come closer to My Son, present in the Eucharist, but with the due preparation, so that you do not offend Him more. In him, only in him will you find the strength to be faithful. Hasten to the true nourishment, do not forget that the ‘Treasure remains in fragile vessels,’ come out of the deception so common in this time and that is proclaimed out loud, affirming that My Son has already suffered for all, and that man is on earth to be happy even when submerged in sin. Overcome the flesh, you are children of the King, overcome it with penance and fasting, overcome evil with truth, because evil comes from the evil one, through deception. The owner of the lie is enraging against man erasing from his heart the gift of humility, and I must tell you that the humble one possesses in addition all the gifts, and humility in man is an indelible seal that like wax is impregnated on his being, giving way to a certain immunity before so much contamination that exists in the air seeking someone to poison through envy and vain gloriousness. Beloved of My Heart; this mother calls you to maintain that union with the father´s house, so that the divine mercies descend upon you, and that way you be those who mark the difference on earth. Little children, the light is not meant to be hidden and in the same way each one of you must be that Divine Image that gives itself to your brothers and sisters in a continual act of love. Keep being salt that seasons and being light in the midst of the darkness. It is urgent that all My children be united in prayer, it is urgent; humanity remains threatened now more than at any other moment. I convoke you to unite your hearts in one in the praying of the holy rosary every day at six o’clock in the afternoon; in every country at six in the afternoon. This prayer should not be missed, it should be continuous; you will see My beloved what you will succeed in minimizing with this Chain of Prayer. Have present that nothing comes about without my son warning his own, and this is a warning, a warning by divine love, I love you, my small and big heroes of this time, I love you; you are My treasure, you are My faithful children in whom Heaven is well pleased. Remain in my Heart. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,7,3,Jesus Christ,July,"Blessed Mother, daughter of God the Father, come to humanity’s aid! Mother of God the son, protect your children! Purest shrine, deliver us from evil and keep it away from us! My beloved, I call you today to be fountains of love and mercy, so that united in complete unity to Our Trinity, you offer up yourselves for all your brothers. You well know, my faithful, that I see all of your sacrifices and they are not in vain. I take into account all of your actions. Even the one you consider to be minimal, before Me, it is of infinite value. My faithful people, I love you so much that I call you not to show off, but rather to act and scatter a scent of mercy everywhere, ‘through prayer’, to battle the forces that hover above humanity, which are increased by so much lack of faith and by so much individualism that moves man, maintaining him in a constant swing, without finding a safe port in which to approach. Children, creation rebels against man because he has lost that divine likeness, which grants him superiority over all that is created. Voluntary sin eliminates the blessings that the Hand of My Father imprinted on His children; the soul, made ugly by sin, makes itself indifferent before creation in general, and creation turns against man, rejecting him again and again. My little children, disobedience, indifference, are a magnet, which at this moment maintains itself over the earth and overflows little by little over humanity, hurrying the time of the fulfilment of all that My Mother and I have announced to you. Violence increases in the world, communism walks slyly, to fulfil the prophecies, and you are not aware of it; the modern antichrists rise to bring suffering to those who are Mine, persecuting them without compassion. My dearly beloved, today I see all that was born from the Hand of My Father, and My Heart suffers before humanity sunken in sin, giving life and death with its free will. My Heart hurts so much! How mercilessly you give death to defenceless innocents through abortion! I see again today Sodom and Gomorrah, and I warn and send mercy through My prophets, and I am despised and challenged, this is the cause of the purification the nations will suffer, one by one. My people, remain awake. I will come soon; I will come when you least expect me. When evil feels triumphant, my holy spirit will come to extinguish the smoke of the fire. Do not fear, a single blow vanishes the smoke. Today I call my priests in a special way, I call you to be strength for My people, to guide them without false modernisms. I call you to fully fulfil your mission; To be strength that battles evil, to be fulfillers of My Will, by example, living the Gospel, to love My faithful, to not take lightly the Sacrament of Confession or the penance. Seek the good of souls and do not forget that your teacher never misestimates any human being. Nor did fatigue defeat him in preaching on time and nontime. I call you my beloved to love that moment in which in your hands, I make myself present on the altar. It is in your hands that I entrust Myself, to give Myself to My people! Do not take me lightly, do not raise me and let me fall so easily, as if you did not recognize my body and blood in your hands! Contemplate me! And give faith to my people. My people need strength from those who are consecrated to me, in order to remain firm at these moments in which purifications get closer to humanity, and in which nature’s attacks will shake man and darkness will come unexpectedly upon him. My beloved people, I live, I live, and I will come for mine, have faith, I will defend you, my mercy is infinite and remains before each one of you. I love you, my children, I love you. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,7,5,Holy Mary,July,"Beloved children, I am Mother of Humanity, My Heart beats for each one of you. All are my beloved children; no one remains outside of My Heart. It is human beings who distance themselves from Me, and do not see Me as Mother. But at the foot of the Cross, My Son entrusted all to Me; not a group, but all and for all of humanity I am here, time and time again announcing, calling, crying out for the return of all My children to a life in God. Beloved of my heart; this mother of the end times comes to you to ask you not to disregard my calls. Prayer is at this moment the very important weapon that humanity needs to confront the proximity of the great events. The Church is being attacked again and again by Satan’s snares, in order to be severely damaged due to divisions. The wolves in sheep’s clothing seek the division of the Church to undermine the throne of My Peter, Benedict XVI. By distorting his words, they will take a big step to fight hard the fidelity of My Peter and attack him without mercy; evil will not remove its sandals to walk on holy ground and will bring My Peter suffering. My children will be confused and follow the one who remains behind the great usurper. When My children awaken and become conscious of their mistake, they will be crying bitterly in the midst of great sufferings. Today I call you to pray. You are My Son’s faithful people, and you should unite yourselves to fortify yourselves and to maintain that faith that gives you the reassurance that you are not alone, My Son is in you. Remain in the peace of God. I love you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,7,15,Holy Mary,July,"Beloved children of my heart, I love each one of you, I love you. Today I come to you once again to call you to maintain yourselves in the state of grace. To live each one of the beatitudes, so that you be humble and true mirrors in which My Son’s love is reflected completely. Man should believe again in himself and in his fellow men. Beloved children, I love you. You are my children and My Heart is open for all! As Mother, I long for that reunion with those who are mine, with those that do not feel or recognize Me as Mother. I wait for them, to welcome them into My Heart. I will be waiting for them along the way, I will be here. My Heart is an Ark which all can enter to be loved and protected from the difficult times that draw near. You will be able to remain in My Heart so that the tempestuous waters of false ideologies do not drag you away or frighten you. I will be here at the moments when nature rebels and you need My protection. Little children, it is not another call, it is a plea of this your Mother who having predicted to you by Divine Grace what is to come, comes before you to offer you this Ark of Salvation: ‘My Immaculate Heart’. Evil will not be able to overcome My children because those who are Mine Carry the weapon that makes the devil tremble: ‘The Rosary’. If you were conscious of the greatness of the Holy Rosary, you would not let a day go by without praying it. My Son gave you to Me, and I gave you the weapon with which you will be victorious. My beloved, Today you should be praying souls and accompany My most beloved Peter with the praying of the Holy Rosary, for the waters are moving against the boat of Peter, and it is extremely important that you, faithful people, you Church, pray, fast, offer sacrifice, to give our beloved Benedict XVI all the spiritual strength he needs to stay on the rudder. You need the prayers of one another. Prayer is important at this time; it is a wall and it should be growing day to day. Little children, there is thirst, Thirst, Thirst for God. You must carry the water that quenches the thirst, not only with word but by being a testimony; not only with prayer but by being a testimony. You should turn daily to the Eucharist, but you should continue to live the Holy Mass during the day and during all the rest of your life. Beloved, continue to be an echo of my pleas, bring your brothers and sisters closer to prayer, invite them to join the wall of permanent prayer, since the proximity of the events and nearness of the fulfilment of the prophecies is generating the discord and confusion you can see in nature and that will bring suffering to all of mankind. Little children, do not disregard My pleas. I love you and desire that you nourish yourselves spiritually so that in that way you may resist the difficult moments that are drawing near. Do not estrange yourselves from the Divine Mercy, the angels of God are waiting on those children who are crying for mercy, to accompany their pleas to the Throne of the Holy Trinity. I love you, children, have peace. Live in the love of My Son, Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,7,23,Holy Mary,July,"My dearly beloved, I bless you; you are my great treasure! You are my children. Today I call you to continue that unity in prayer, it is balsam that rises up to Our Throne, and returns to humanity in abundant blessings, so that each one of you is sustained with that unique strength of My faithful People. At all moments it has been My faithful People who have maintained themselves united as one, to combat and conquer in My Name. My mercy is a protective and defending shield, it is a shield forged with infinite love, and you know well that love is the weapon that conquers and defeats the malignant forces. Prayer gives one the strength to get up after every fall. My most beloved children, My Mother is gathering you, through constant calls. We are uniting My People, from all the ends of the earth; We are alerting all the faithful, so that One may be the Word and there is no confusion, and in this way, you discern which is the Word that comes from on high and which is the word that can lead you astray from what is Our Will. Beloved, today I call you once more to follow me knowing that My path is for the brave, the daily abnegation is for the brave, the change of your way of life, the turning away from sin, the being humble, the being in solidarity with your brothers and sisters, the carrying of the banner of My Love, children, it is for the brave. And I know well that each one of you, my children, to whom I speak today, you My People, are the brave, those heroes I have come to seek, so that you live and spread My calls and those of My Mother, Mother of all of humanity. Today I call you, to not give up, to not be discouraged, to continue on my path in the midst of the avalanche of the mundane. Do not forget My beloved, that you do not walk alone; the cross is one and you do not carry it alone. Even though sometimes it may seem too heavy, never forget, that I carry it beside each one of you; do not forget that I walked the road to Calvary before you, so that it is more bearable for you. Do not forget that the Cross is one, man’s cross is my Cross. This is the reason for which… it is victory and not defeat it is life and not death, it is resurrection and that is what I desire of each of you children; that you live in a constant resurrection of love. Constantly be servants, fulfillers, lovers of My Word, without looking around to see what everyone else is doing, without criticizing your brother and sister, but rather being that living, permanent, constant testimony of what is My infinite Love, My infinite Mercy. My Mother calls you constantly to be living testimonies; it is the Mother of each one of you who gives the example, serving all her children, being a symbol of unity. She came to serve, and today I call you to be imitators of My Mother: ‘be servants of your brothers and sisters.’ little children, do you love me? Trust in me! Do not despair before what is to come, trust that My Mercy waits for you. I thirst for those who are Mine; return to Me; a repentant sinner is cause for rejoicing in My House. Here I am at this moment, before you, merely take my hand, look, listen to my heart that beats for you, give me your hand, I am your Jesus, come to me, repent; for me it will be the first time, I love you, in my own way. Little children, I am gathering you into a single People, in My Heart, in My Mercy, in My Mother’s Heart. Have faith, do not fear, Awaken! The time grows short, awaken, you are not alone! Be a testimony. I love you; I bless you; you are My People. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,7,25,Holy Mary,July,"Children of my immaculate heart, I bless you, I call you to give yourselves to my son, to the fulfilment of the commandments, so that you live in true peace. Maintain yourselves alert, my children, because man’s ambition has no limits, and it will drive him to fight against himself. Today the law of the strongest reigns and this increases until the thread breaks and once again peace will be trampled at the whim of the strongest. Dearly beloved, with sorrow I see how communism is growing in countries that used to possess a solid peace; it is painful to see how peace is in grave danger. It is in the hands of those who do not worry about the neediest, but rather on the contrary, they dedicate themselves to oppressing the humble, the needy, the poor, to make them bend and in that way succeed in making them join in ideas totally contrary to mercy, love, the Will of God, and then ‘the rebellion against the Church’ will be fulfilled. Beloved of My Heart, communism is flying, like another plague, and will bring with it as such: Pain, oppression, death, hunger, persecution of innocents. This is the reason for which I insist on continual prayer, the Church joined in a single heart, sure that this Your Mother watches over you. You do not remain alone, or at the expenses of the enemy; but it is necessary that you continue in unity, that you live far from the worldly things that taint the soul. Sin disguises itself in a million ways and you, my little children, need to remain in the state of grace so that you discern and do not let yourselves be deceived when the wolves in sheep’s clothing present sin to you disguised as good actions. Children, I call you to pray the Holy Rosary, I call you to remain united, do not forget it, I as Mother, cover you with My Mantle, I hold your hand, I offer Myself as an Ark so that in My Heart, you remain protected and keep the faith. My love is a spring and I desire to give you of this water that fortifies the spirit, encourages and intercedes. Dearly beloved, peace is a gift from God, but at the same time it is and will be a conquest of each one of you, to whom My Son has given the duty of being peacemakers. Today especially I call you to live peace inside yourselves, so that being living testimonies for all your neighbours, you might be witnesses of whom dwells in your interior. These are not times to live half-heartedly; at this moment you are called more than at any other time to be true. To live in spirit and truth. The lukewarm will be swayed with great ease towards evil and will succumb in the claws of the malignant one, the ones who are lukewarm will not see the true light, they will be easily confused. You are My children, and around the world I announce to you, time and time again the events that draw near. You are already suffering the attacks of those who feel they possess the human power in the world, and you are already suffering the attacks of nature as it rebels against man and his sins. Little children, do not get tired; I know that the wait on occasions makes it seem that all that has been announced is far from happening. Do not forget that God is the master of time, and the Cups are spilling. Today I call you to continue preparing yourselves with what is necessary to face what is coming, first of all spiritually, and then prepare foods of first necessity. You must supply yourselves to help your brothers and sisters, the Hand of God will multiply however much is necessary; do not doubt the Divine Providence. Dearly beloved children of My Heart, pray, pray, pray. Do not forget that the Divine Mercy waits for the sinner to forgive him, welcome him, love him. I call you to hurry and seek out the forgiveness of sins; no repentant sinner is left without the help of God. I love you My children, I love you; you are My Son’s People and I am Your Mother.

2009,7,30,Holy Mary,July,"Dearly beloved of my heart, little children, I love you, and as Mother of all of humanity I call you to keep the faith! Do not deviate from the path by looking to the sides; walk looking at the Face of My Son, that with love and mercy calls you to approach Him more each day. Children, the constant refusals of My calls are already being lived out. My tears around the world are for those who do not turn their gaze, who do not open their hearts, who do not obey the constant calls of My Son and this mother. My tears are for the pain that many of My oppressed children live because of the power of the enemy. My tears at this moment are for Mine, who are being persecuted, for those who wish to silence My calls so that I do not warn you about the presence of the dragon that hurls itself against you. My tears are for all that approaches humanity; they are for those who are beginning their suffering caused by the dragon of communism, that is taking power in the midst of falsehoods in order to confuse some of My children. Beloved, today I wish to invite you to again retake My calls, it is necessary that, again, you read and remember so that you see how that what appeared to be far away, is already moving in the midst of humankind; I invite you to meditate on My calls in the places that are most recognized. The humblest should keep in mind that just as the birds of the sky are fed, so will you be fed; only have faith in the Divine Providence. Pray, ask; My Son will make Manna descend to feed His People. Do not forget that what you have, will be multiplied at the necessary moment, but have faith that you will never be without God’s Divine help. Dearly beloved children, remain alert before the signs that manifest themselves clearly, so that as faithful People, you maintain yourselves prepared and give testimony of what dwells in your heart. Being that blind person´s guide who leads whoever needs him towards the light that does not go out, through paths of faith, hope, mercy and love. Little children, I remain before each one of you. Do not forget it, I am a mother, when my children call, my heart does not resist; where you meet to pray and invoke my assistance, I make myself present there, I am not resistant to the plea, the call, the love of those who are mine. I have talked to you so much about the power and the importance of prayer! I am not resistant to it; therefore, do not doubt that where you invoke Me, I go there ‘with haste’. Do not cease to make pilgrimage to the places where I speak to you. Faith captivates Me and I am with each one of you, the prayer of those who are Mine captivates Me. Do not become desensitized to the pain, the anguish of your fellow men; you are one in the Hands of the Potter, and you grow in the measure with which you succeed in being love to all your brothers and sisters. Do not forget the responsibility that you have acquired in the prayer of intercession for My dearly beloved Peter, ‘Holy Father’. Dearly beloved of My Heart; you are the great treasure, I bless you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,8,13,Holy Mary,August,"Dearly beloved of my Immaculate Heart, Receive My love, beloved children; My Heart remains open for each one of you. You know well that you are inevitably already living the fulfilment of the prophecies, and you know that some of your brothers and sisters deny it, even though all are participants in one form or another of what is occurring. Today many of those who are Mine reject My Son’s Love and reject My calls, this rejection has generated hate, so much so, that today death is a thing of men and not a sole Power of God. Violence is bringing humanity so many calamites! Children, all of creation sees you as distant…. there is so much sin! Pride, avarice, lust, anger, gluttony, jealousy, slothfulness over abounds. These capital vices are products of the laborious work of satan to make man lose his way at this tenebrous moment of decay. Walk carefully, my beloved children. Today more than at any other moment, satan finds a thousand and one ways to deceive you; today he raises entire countries against the faith, and he scoffs at the man who he succeeds in smearing them in stubbornness, so that later the human being himself laments his own foolishness, since he has only sown ryegrass. Beloved of My Heart, the Cups overflow over you without being perceived by all; only by those who remain faithful and attentive to the calls of the Paternal House. Today it is My Love that alerts you to remain in Grace, to carry sacramentals, to not forget those ‘medicines of faith’ that I have revealed to you for the unknown illnesses, to bless what you ingest, to prepare yourselves with all that is necessary, to conserve in every home, not only the Sacred Scriptures, but devotional books, to not forget the holy water to sign yourselves with each day, to pray the Holy Rosary as a family and be Love in the likeness of My Son. Little children, we give you the means and more to defend yourselves, to protect yourselves. This is your time, of the loving response to Merciful God; everything has been announced to you Today at this time of pain, you do not manage to see between what is false and what is true, between good and evil. The heart of many remains eclipsed, it does not allow you to hear My loving voice that cries out to your hearts to return to the true path. Man’s pride will make him reach bottom because of his constant rejections of the Will of God, and it will be the hour of satan; power will be given to him over those who are a stumbling stone to the Plan of Salvation that as Mother of humanity and by Divine design I bring you. Have you forgotten my call at Fatima? If you prayed the holy rosary! How many souls would be saved by the intercession of the just! There are those who fight against Me, because they want more souls to be lost. My Son on the Cross, was thirsting for souls, and still continues to thirst for souls. Do not be the ones to give Him vinegar and not the best wine. Be, beloved children, the forgers of the intercession for your brothers and sisters, the ones who spread the devotion to the Holy Rosary. I your mother wish to save you, and time is running out. Pray, pray, pray. I have never left unattended the petitions of those who turn to me. Beloved, invoke Saint Michael the Archangel; he is ready to aid you at every moment, to take you in the right path; He remains over the victorious, persevering and obedient to God, to protect you. Little children, I love you, do not neglect My calls. Unite in prayer for one another. I love you. Mother Mary. Prayer to Saint Michael the archangel: ‘Saint Michael Archangel defend us in battle, and protect us against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke satan, we humbly pray, and by God´s Power may you, Prince of the Heavenly Host, cast him into hell with all the evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen. Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us with your sword, guide us with your light, and cover us with your wings. Amen.’",,,,,,,
2009,9,9,Holy Mary,September,"Beloved children, I keep you within My Heart, the Ark where I protect all who come to Me. Once again, I call you to maintain yourselves in a firm and immovable faith, nourished by the daily Eucharist, by persistent prayer, and by continuous petition so that the Holy Spirit assists you at every moment, and that way you succeed before the continual coming and going of the ambushes of the devil, who at this time attacks the children of God. Evil presents itself in a million ways, and only discernment will lead you to take the correct path. The enemy is fighting insistently; he remains in a constant battle against each faithful child. The enemy maintains himself in constant battle in order to distance, confuse, and above all, discourage My Son’s Church. All that is happening around the world, events of nature, slaughter, extreme hunger, plagues...is the product of all that man himself sows in his heart. Life is not valued as a gift, but rather as a possession whose end can be decided. Most dearly beloved children, this is nothing other than a sign of how much lack of affection, how much vainglory is in the heart of man. My faithful children accompany Me in this great pain that My Heart suffers before so much offense against God. Each one of you has to be aware of what is happening in the world; and with a fine eye, analyse these events behind which the devil himself is hiding, preparing the hearts of those who are lukewarm to act against their God, and against their brothers and sisters. This possession of the devil, that as master saunters throughout the world in search of souls who live far from God to take power over them and bring humanity more pain, has brought as a consequence that there be slaughter, the promulgation of laws favouring abortion, the proliferation of other mediums of extermination that are being used nowadays; that it does not touch the human heart to see a brother and sister dying of hunger, the indifference towards the physical or spiritual suffering of fellow human beings. This is not normal among those who have been created by the Hand of the same Father. This is called lack of affection, hatred, obliviousness, rancour, and is caused by the enemy of men, by the same demon that hardens men, eating away at their hearts and saturating them himself with all the evil that he gives off as master of darkness. My children, these measures that today are pride of many, such as matrimony between human beings of the same sex, abortion, adoption of children by couples of the same sex, the giving of orders to untimely remove without any fear the Name of God from all act or work of man; these sins and others that cause My Son’s Heart and Mine to bleed, are taken back in time, to recall the sin that was lived by Sodom and Gomorra. And today, children, today I must tell you with sorrow that the sin of the present has surpassed the sin of the past. At this instant, sin has taken power, and this is a fundamental part of modernism, mainly among the youth. But I cannot deny that the adults are also submerged in painful acts against the integrity of the defenceless. Today humanity sees sin as something natural; it is forgetting its Creator, and this brings to man, evils and illnesses which are an irrefutable sign of the proximity of all that approaches humanity. This is the time in which evil has penetrated man so much, that it turns against man himself. I know well that you know the prophecies, which have not been made known to go by unnoticed or to cause man fear. No, the prophecies have been announced so man takes them into account and changes, but this has not been attained, and everything is spilling over humanity. There is darkness in all the earth. It is the darkness of sin, that is freeing itself over humanity and will bring what for man will be the long night, in which the demons will come out of their caverns in search of lukewarm souls or souls that are totally distanced from God, in order to submerge them in sin. This is the reason for which, already at this time, the partisans of the devil of inferior status, are coming out little by little, and in this way are taking possession of the will of the human beings without God, guiding them so they commit so many crimes, so many aberrations, so much drug addiction, so much outrage against the innocents. This time is a time of crisis. My Son’s people are in crisis because of their stubbornness, their voluntary estrangement from God, their worshiping of false gods. The past is repeating itself, and man punishes himself as long as he does not recognize his sin. Uncontrolled aggressiveness lives next to each one of you; this is the reason not to separate yourselves from prayer, from the Eucharist, from love; be true. Little children, do you wish to overcome temptation? Pray so you do not fall, be the lamps that illuminate, be unity, maintain the faith so that you can claim victory for the Glory of God. The mercy of God is before you, even at this moment of great darkness. God is love, and his love gives itself to mankind in a constant act of total donation; therefore, take that divine love that the father himself is offering you. Most beloved children, remain sure of the Divine Presence in each human being; do not let the powerful ones of the world frighten you, because above them remains ‘the One who is Master over all that has been created’. Obey, prepare yourselves, do not be of those who listen to the slight breathings of the governments, giving false securities to their own. Continue to lay aside for the more difficult times, since these are about to come; prepare yourselves and do not forget that for those who remain in the faith, God multiplies however much they possess, so that they share with their brothers and sisters. My beloved children, this Mother invites you today to pray with strength and faith; so much, that it gives light where there is darkness. Do not forget that God is God of love and forgiveness. I love you. Mother Mary",,,,,,,
2009,9,23,Holy Mary,September,"Dearly beloved of My Heart, Come to My Heart, here I will keep you united and protected. People of God, my Heart remains open for all; come to this, your Mother; the unity of the People of God is necessary. Unity in prayer for all that is happening in all the world, the chaos of sin is causing destruction everywhere, the chaos of sin is devouring hearts, consciences, thoughts. Beloved, sin consumes, it clouds man’s thinking; this is the reason for which there is such great violence among human beings. The multiform aspect of sin behind which it hides, does not allow you to perceive the seriousness of all that moves all around you at this time, in which human life is looked upon with disdain. At this instant in which you live, evil is engaged in open warfare with humanity and it takes advantage of man’s refusal to obey My Son’s call to conversion. The devil takes possession of men more every day. The approval of laws that go against the commandments of God’s Law, will make you fall into an abyss from which you will not be able to get out of, until you acknowledge the offense committed. The smoke of evil is ascending towards man and man lets himself be contaminated, being consumed in the mud with great pleasure. Children, understand that the way of the Antichrist is being prepared, and he comes raising up his empire upon sin in all its aspects. Open your eyes, see what you are allowing; for the more harm man causes himself, the more he quickens the coming of the one who will govern evil and persecution of all of humanity, especially of those who because of fidelity to My Son, will not be followers of the one who will bring terror. Little children, look at how much power communism is taking throughout all the world. It is growing by leaps and bounds; the sleeping beast has woken up and it reappears with power, buying consciences with money; look at with how much subtlety the small nations are congregating and forming satellite unions of communism, spreading ideologies totally contrary to the Will of God. The open persecution against those who do not profess these communist ideologies is not far. This is the motive of My call, so that you who hear Me, are those faithful who fight by means of continuous prayer and the preaching testimony of love to your neighbour, of faith towards the Most Holy Trinity. Go to receive My Son in the Eucharist so that fortified, you continue the path without a backward step. Take refuge in My Heart, battle with the weapon that is the Rosary, do not cease to pray it and offer it for humanity, for strength and conversion of all the heretics and sinners. You the faithful people, must pray with fervour, without decaying; prayer conquers all. THE ONE WHO PRAYS, PERSEVERES. My beloved, it is urgent, urgent, that you unite in a chain of prayer throughout all the world. My Son hears you, even more at these moments in which the groan of the beast can be heard, howling with labour pains. Beloved of My Heart, constantly renew the Consecration to Our Hearts, and stay in US. My Son and this Mother love you and protect you. Do not stray from this path to which the Father called you and entrusted you protect; do not become separated from the Church that My Son instituted. Be strong, persevere in faith, do not go off course, remain united to the Most Holy Trinity and do not forget that I will keep you protected in My Heart at all times. I love you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,9,29,Archangel Michael,September,"Children of the Owner of Heaven and Earth, do not fear, you are children of the king, and every knee bends before him. Walk with security giving adoration in every act you perform, loving God above all things. Be fulfillers of the Will of God. You are protected by the Father; you are the ‘apple of His eye’ but you must stay on the correct path. Do not let yourselves get wrapped up in the mundane, this only leads you astray and causes you to hesitate, to fall. These are the devil’s strategies, he presents to you as very attractive all that leads you away from that Column in which all human beings should walk. Be humble; this is the distinctive mark of the children of God. The proud will perish. Remain attentive, for the King does not do anything without warning His own. What was announced is happening now; this is the reason the signs will be more evident from now on. Do not let them convince you that all that happens has an explanation, because the more explanation man wants to give to the affairs from Above, the more confusion he will find. Maintain yourselves alert without being afraid, with faith and with the security that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit look upon you with infinite love; and we, ‘those sent from God to protect you’ are here beside you to give you help whenever you ask for it. Live in the Peace of the Triune God. Who is like to God! St. Michael the Archangel.",,,,,,,
2009,10,3,Jesus Christ,October,"Beloved children of My Heart, once again I invite you to come to me, I come to call my people to congregate around my table. I love you; My Mercy remains open for all, without reservations, for all, you only need to invite Me wholeheartedly and with firm intention of emendation. So many things disperse you, separating you from Me. Evil presents you with so many tempting facets every instant of the day, so that you do not have any time to come to Me, and you My beloved, fall in the trap and wrap yourselves up in the world. That is the reason for My calls to fraternal love, to love within families, to love your neighbour, to be testimonies of My Love. Today I entrust to you My People the battle to confront the evil that invades more and more hearts every day. I entrust you to do battle in love, being My witnesses at all times. It is necessary that you spread love towards all your brothers and sisters, because evil is taking possession of those who live rejecting Me, and with these human beings, the great usurper, the devil is opening the expected path to reclaim and take possession of souls. At these moments the fear of the course that humanity is taking because of the uncertainty before a future that is not promising, is being utilized by the beast that is planning its great apparition, presenting itself as an angel of light, and carrier of salvation for all peoples. And look! What has man done with My Creation? What does man do with My Love? What does man do before the calls of My Mother, who intercedes for you? Rejection is what We receive, rejection, scorn, indifference, and even those who obey my calls and make them known to humanity are called crazy. Poor children of My Heart! They will weep; they will weep before the pain that they will carry by handing themselves over into the hands of those who only seek to control them in order to give them over into enemy hands. They will be given into the hands of the whom they will receive as king, he who will later turn into king of terror for My People. So many warnings, so many signs! And even so they will fall into the hands of the evil one, into usurping hands. They made fun of Noah when he obeyed My Father; today they make fun of and even persecute those who obey Me and proclaim My calls in a loud voice. In the past man disobeyed and brought punishment upon himself; today man disobeys and opens over himself again the magnet that attracts the punishment that will descend. This is the reason for My call, so that you who listen to My Word, might be light, torch, lighthouse that cries out in one voice, so that many souls might not be lost and your brothers and sisters might not close their hearts to the calls of My House. Beloved children, your brothers and sisters do not understand the urgency of My calls and those of My Mother. Pray and make reparation; there is so much violence at this moment. Violence incrusts itself in the human heart without the heart perceiving it. It is a plague that scatters itself without being desired, but it is accepted by many who do not perceive the seriousness of the events that surround them. Wake up! For the beast is taking possession of humanity in exchange for a false stability among the people. The sting of the beast has introduced itself into the world, and it is guiding the minds of men with its venom, leading them to act against My Commandments. The blood of the innocents to whom you deny the right to life will spill over humanity. The one who acts in this way has on his hands such a great offense! My beloved children, do not justify evil; I do not punish you; it is man who punishes himself, for lack of correspondence with regards to what he has received from Our House. Beloved, not even nature recognizes you anymore, but rather it revolts before humanity’s disobedience. Now is the awaited moment! The lack of love compels me to look for those who are mine. I come with my mercy. I come to look for you. Once again, I call you to raise your voice, to not be silent, to be brave and to alert those who are Mine. Once again, I call you to seal the doors of your homes with holy oil. It is necessary My beloved, it is necessary, but above all, it is necessary that at every instant you maintain yourselves in constant conversion, and remain in the state of grace. I will help you at all times. Raise your voice, do not be silent; you are My children, and My children raise their voices with fidelity. Unite yourselves in My Heart. I love you, My People, I love you. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,10,15,Holy Mary,October,"Beloved children of My Immaculate Heart, I love you. Congregated by the Love of My Son, once again I call you to be faithful fulfillers of the Commandments, faithful observers of the Sacraments and followers of the Beatitudes, as it is the duty of the children of God. You walk continually in the midst of the egoism of men who live without God, without love in their hearts, without hearing My Son’s calls or My calls. They allow evil to use them to make you lose heart, you faithful children, who at these moments are being attacked, tempted, bombarded by those who live of the mundane and nourish themselves with sin, so that you decline in faith. My Son and this your Mother have announced well to you that these attacks would take place, but you saw them as distant, just as you see the events that We announced to you as being distant. Do not wait for the persecution of My Son’s faithful People; you are already living it! Or do you not see how you are persecuted by your own brothers and sisters merely because you live in a way contrary to that of the world? The enemy wishes to tire you and pull you away from the straight path on which you walk. Today you are persecuted; you are already entering into the times when the enemy will pour out his evil among mankind so that the persecution of the Church is more evident, since actually a great majority of My children lets the cruel acts that are taking place at this precise moment pass unnoticed. Beloved little children of My Heart, soften your hearts, be more sensitive of the pain of your fellow human beings, shower creation with love by means of continuous prayer. More than the necessary arms have been given to you, pray so that you are not found sleeping, pray so that you do not fall into temptation, come, appeal to the merciful love of the Sacrosanct Trinity. Little children, do not look at the past seeking martyrs, look around you and you will find martyrs because of hunger, martyrs because of war, martyrs due to abortion, martyrs due to their own parents, martyrs, martyrs that I can enumerate without end; martyrs of man’s egoism for man. Beloved of My Heart, the signs are evident and if you do not want to see them, it is because your heart is attracted too much by the tasks of the world that it does not allow you to make a stop on the road to see the reality that surrounds you. Little children, humanity is moving up rapidly nears its end and my Son’s intermediate coming is near. I have called you to seal your homes, so that evil and the plague pass by without stopping, and you have hurried obediently to follow My instructions. But you still do not understand that if the doors and windows of the home are sealed and the human being continues to be lukewarm, evil and the plague will enter and will make you succumb to sin. I call you to not tire of giving testimony of the divine love that dwells in you. Trust in God, in his mercy and you will see his glory. This is the moment for bended knees; pray, pray without losing heart, for My Son will give you a great warning, prepare yourselves for this great day of Mercy; prepare yourselves because the enemy will be on the attack against those who are lukewarm and do not remain fortified. Little children, you know that you have in your hand the key that will lead you to overcome any battle. This key is ‘love’; be a living testimony of My Son’ love, repent without delay, so that this next coming moment does not find you in sin. Many of your brothers and sisters will awaken this day at seeing the state of sin in which they find themselves. Each one of you My beloved children, will feel alone with your conscience, each one will be alone before his/her spiritual state. This is the reason for which I call you, to be sorry for the sins you have committed, to make a firm resolution of amendment, to keep the Commandments, to fortify yourselves with the Body and Blood of My Son in the Eucharist, to persevere in prayer, to live in fraternal love, to not commit mundane, despicable actions, to remain firm in faith, so that you may form part of the new generation. I love you, little children, I love you. Heed my supplications, do not lose heart, be obedient, for time has run out. My Son’s Merciful Heart waits for you burning with Love. I wait for you to harbour you in My Heart and protect you from evil. Heed this, My plea of love. Come children, I guide you towards My Son. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,11,7,Holy Mary,November,"Dearly beloved children of My Heart, I love you. You are My great treasure. Each one of you remains within My Heart. I protect you at every moment with My Maternal Mantle. I call you today to not separate yourselves from prayer; you must be lamps that illuminate the darkness that persists over humanity at this moment. Each day evil seizes those who live without God, and wreaks havoc on innocents, the evil one has enraged brutally against life; this is the cause of so much violence, of so much death at the hands of man himself. That is why I call you to pray for your brothers and sisters. You must be intercessors, without weakening, so that the Divine Love that spreads over all souls is received voluntarily by all. Evil is fought with love, so love that dwell in you must grow quickly in order to be multiplied through all of creation. I have already announced to you previously about these events occurring nowadays, the ones that will increase with the passing of the days; just as I talked to you about an event that will cause astonishment and will affect the Church, the Church that I love so much! This is another reason for you to fortify yourselves in faith, so that you nourish yourselves with the Eucharist, so that you walk in unity and do not stagger. The evil one hates unity, and tries to separate My children. But I am here, and I do not abandon you. You take no notice of My calls, and deliberately ignore that you are living ‘only’ the beginning of the fulfilment of all that I have announced to you. You seek for another explanation in order to flee from reality, you remain deaf to the Word that Heaven sends you, you make fun of all that is God. You despise Him, you even wish to make Him disappear, this is nothing other than the product of the desire for power of those who are preparing a single government, a single coin, through which they will subjugate humanity in order to hand it over into the hands of the Antichrist. Do not let this make you back down! You do not walk alone; keep the faith. Children, Open your eyes! Man, in his eagerness for power, desires to exile God from His own creation, that is why I turn to you My children, so that you increase prayer and prepare yourselves for this very difficult present in which you live and for those times that are coming. This ‘present’ is difficult ‘now,’ ‘yes’ because everything has accelerated; you have vertiginously entered into the fulfilment of the prophecies. I have already announced to you previously that you live the ‘now’ because time has run out; but do not be afraid, My Son’s Mercy in infinite, and everyone who comes repentantly and amends his or her life is welcomed with infinite Love. Little children, I love you. I suffer for humanity; I intercede for each one of you. I watch with pain how you reject God, from every place, and I suffer more for those who do not desire God in their life. You already know, ‘there will come times in which man will live without God. They will be times more contaminated with sin than the times of Sodom and Gomorra. Sin will be overabundant and man will give himself over into the hands of the one who will come to usurp the Throne of Peter; the one will come for the booty, for souls in order to lead them to the eternal fire. They will be days of pain, persecution and death; but in the end my immaculate heart will Triumph, and the serpent along with his own will be chained up, and the children of God will live eternally. Onward, little children. Pray so that you do not fall into temptation, so that the enemy does not find you sleeping. Continue giving love, and illuminating in the midst of the darkness, each one of you is a torch in which My Son reflects His Love. I love you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,11,27,Jesus Christ,November,"My Beloved People, receive My blessing. Once again, I come to My Flock, to My own whom I ask for love, love for your brother and sisters; love at every moment. Just as you receive it from Me, you must show it towards your fellow man. At this moment in which humanity sinks itself in a lack of affection, you, my soldiers, must fight with My Love, and united as one, we will triumph, even though before you, everything seems to indicate otherwise. My path is not easy but it is filled with satisfaction, fortitude, faith because I do not leave you alone, and My Mother helps you at every moment, just as My angels watch over you constantly, maintaining themselves before each one of you and guiding you in the path. The present moment is not easy for you, My beloved. The heart aches before so much violence, evil, lack of sincerity, untruth, but above all the lack of faith in My Word and disobedience of My calls. Nature shows you the promptness of events, and humanity walks sunken in uncontrolled lust, that leads each day to a devaluation of the gift of life, to living as if in a jungle, where the strongest one survives. My heart aches because of so much existing violence; I cannot hold back all that is approaching any longer. In the future, you who do know My calls and their urgency, you will see each sign with confidence in My protection, but at the same time with astonishment since you well know the outcome. I have called you so much to reconsider the works and actions of each one of you! But daily living surrounds you time and time again in that precipice from which I cannot rescue you if you do not change your way of life. Soon very soon, nature itself will mark the pace. She rebels against man more every day, she who is similar to our Will. Nature rebels against man who makes her suffer every day, because man walks against his Creator. Today I call My faithful to redouble prayer, so they maintain that invincible, firm faith, in which not only you and yours take refuge, but also all those who are near you. You are My hope so that no more souls are lost; that should be the slogan of each one of you, my faithful, winning souls, making them see the truth of the events and redoubling prayer, without forgetting that the praying of the Holy Rosary is blessing, balsam, shield, sword; it is defence, love, and protection. It is urgent that the world knows and is conscious of the time in which you live, and it is only by means of the diffusion of My calls that some will be touched and will stop to think about the signs of this instant. Little children, My Israel, the moment urges, prepare yourselves, the moment urges. The fulfilment is at the door. Violence, moral decay, lead Me to precipitate all that has been announced for love of you, for mercy. My love exceeds all limits that man imagines; a single instant of your sincere repentance is enough for Me to forgive and love, love and forgive. In its place I receive offenses, oblivion, scorn; in its place nations approve laws with which they make fun of Me, with which they slap My Face time and time again, ignoring Me, defying Me, distancing Me from the sight of those who are Mine so that they forget Me, accepting the shameful laws by means of which human beings of the same sex unite, causing My Heart pain. My dearly beloved, this is only the beginning of all that awaits humanity, humanity that came out of My Father’s Hand because of love, and now it turns against the Divine Love, in order to submerge itself in the clutches of satan who is deceiving you well and will distance you from Me, because you will cease to look at Me, to love Me, to need Me. You My faithful, pray, so all that My Mother insistently announces comes soon, comes soon, and more souls are not lost. It seems that time and time again I repeat what you already know, but it is because on occasions My People forget My Word; and it is My duty, to bring to your mind, to your heart, the nearness of all that I have announced to you. Beloved, comprehend the urgency of My call. There is no more time, there is no more time, there is no more time! Maintain yourselves close to Me, to My Mother; ask for fortitude, and do not be rushed into action, so that you give testimony of My Love that dwells in you. Be brave, do not be afraid to defend the faith in My Word, even though because of that they call you crazy. Do not forget that I suffered for you, My Treasure. Now each one of you has a treasure to defend, for which to fight, and this treasure is your brothers and sisters. Dearly beloved children of My Heart, there is no time. And what must be done when there is no time? Take refuge and prepare yourselves. So, ‘Let anyone with ears to hear listen!’. Violence will increase to unknown and unthinkable levels. Redouble love, unity, faith, and prayer. We walk, yes, we walk united to the encounter with what is announced. Do not fear, I am with you, and My angels raise their swords to defend you. My Spirit gives you Words of wisdom, so that they pierce the heart of those who are still waiting for a Word in order to return to Me, that as beggar of Love, begs, asks and loves. Only when man faces his own reality will he wish time to turn back. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,11,28,Holy Mary,November,"Dearly beloved children of My Immaculate Heart, as we begin this time of blessing that is ‘Advent,’ I intercede before the Throne of the Most Holy Trinity, for all of My children, those whom I received at the foot of the Cross of Salvation. I come to call you once more, so that united with this Mother, you form a wall of prayer. The greatest of all time, and solicit hearts to soften minds to be enlightened the human will to accede to My Son’s calls. The Mission is one: ‘To love God above all things and to love your neighbour as yourself.’ This Divine Commandment is merciful, not only for your neighbour but for each one of you, My beloved. It is urgent for man to be conscious of the First Commandment, today more than before, since humanity walks far from love and all that can be derived from love. Beloved, unity of the faithful is urgent, very urgent. Division and lack of love is the strength of the devil, strength that blackens the mind and heart of man, leading him to give himself over every day to vices, to violence. This is why it is my children’s duty to fight with the weapon of prayer; with the powerful weapon of the Holy Rosary. Dearly beloved of My Heart, man is not conscious of how he is estranging himself from his Creator; man seeks an explanation for all that occurs and instead dedicates himself to persecuting My Son’s Church, without seeing that this is only the fulfilment of what I have announced to you by Divine Will all around the world in continuous calls. The Church is being openly persecuted, and this persecution will increase. The prophecies will be fulfilled because man does not change! With pain I see how humanity is going to punish itself for its disobedience. So much crime, so much blasphemy generates pain. Little children, the error of Communism spreads throughout the earth like air and the signs occur day to day without the majority taking notice of them, like it is happening at this moment. Extreme hunger will be greater every day, natural disasters will increase, the desire for power of the great nations will end in great calamities for all of humanity. Dearly beloved of My Heart, may this time of Advent increase in each one of you the desire of love for your fellow man, the desire of constant prayer, the intention that each word, movement, act, thought, be worship for the Most Holy Trinity and edification for the Faithful. You do not walk in vain; you do not sail without course; obedience is the rudder that assures the arrival to a safe port. Remain united; my son is the support of his people. This your Mother will not grow tired of calling Her children time and time again, as much as is necessary, in order for them to console My Son’s Heart and My Heart, which are constantly pierced by so many sins, blasphemies, irreverence and ingratitude. May this be a moment of prayer, of reparation, of love, of intercession for your brothers and sisters and of atonement. Pray, constancy in prayer is absolutely necessary. I bless you, dearly beloved children. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,12,2,Our Father,December,"My beloved people, at this time of Advent, it is a wish of Our Trinity that you gestate in the womb of the Mother of all men. At this instant, it is absolutely necessary that you feed yourselves, nourish yourselves, form yourselves, fortify yourselves with the love of the Mother of all of humanity. So that you take from Her, Her same Love, Her same kindness, Her same mercy, Her same patience, Her same amiability, Her same love of neighbour, Her unconditional surrender to the Will of Our Trinity; Her same ‘Fiat’ at every moment and in every situation of her existence. It is absolutely necessary that at this instant you nourish yourselves of Her same prudence, of Her same obedience that at every moment, without seeing and hearing other voices, she walked with Her sight fixed on the Will of Our Trinity. In the same way, place yourselves in, gestate in that virginal womb of the Mother, the one that We gave to you so She is the Arc, the Tabernacle where you take refuge, where you nourish yourselves at every instant of your existence. We have given each one of you ‘a Treasure:’ It has been, it is and it will be before each one of you, to all the same, without discriminating against any child, no matter how much of a sinner he or she considers himself or herself to be. Our mercy is infinite and we give to all, as our children, an equal measure of the inheritance, but some gather more, others gather less and others do not want to gather any of Our inheritance. This instant so delicate for all of humanity in general, it is at the same time an instant in which you must open your heart, mind, ‘all your senses,’ but above all you must open yourselves to the faith in Our Word and to the calls of the Blessed Mother, so that you nourish yourselves with all that She constantly brings you, so that obedient to Her guidance, you are led by the correct path, the safe path, by the path in which there are no deviations of human egoism. It is essential that in these days of Advent you gestate in the Mother’s womb, so that you may be reborn to a new life, so that the human egoism, which is the common denominator in deterring all men, is thrown at the foot of the Cross of Redemption and Salvation forever. Each one of you has his inheritance in front of him. Take it! Take advantage of it! Multiply it! For just as the fishes and loaves were multiplied, so will all that you need in this spiritual journey be multiplied so that you manage to pronounce that unconditional ‘Fiat’ to Our Trinity. Why stop along the path, seeing or hearing other voices? Why stop along the path, because of what will others say, and how will they take to your walking in holiness, or because of what your brothers and sisters say about you? My People, you are My Apostles and each one preaches, each one preaches with his or her example, with his or her love, with his or her absolute commitment. You preach with testimony and that is what as Father, I come to ask you today. I come today to energetically ask you for this testimony that as my people, you are obligated to give. From now on, let it not be the human I that hurts, that feels offended, that sees, that feels, that listens. From now on, fight so that the human will that holds My People back is annulled, so that as Father I can pour over each one of you all of the necessary gifts and virtues, and with your testimony, those that do not believe, those that persecute Me, those that hate Me, those that hurt My Heart second to second, those that blaspheme against Me, are overcome by the commitment, the giving, the following of My People, or perhaps, My People, is it that you have forgotten that from My Hands proceeds all that you possess? Today I speak energetically, I call my people with a loving petition, with my heart in my hand My People, what has become of you? My People, where are you? My People, raise your voice without fearing persecution, without being afraid of what they will say! My People, fix your sight on Me today and take refuge, take refuge and let yourself be gestated and nourished by the Full of Grace. Take this Mother in every moment, She will conduct you to a safe port! I, as Father of all humanity, bless you and just as today I have asked you, where are you, My People? So today I also tell you that I bless you for listening to My calls. But, children, these are urgent moments and I need a total and unconditional donation, one of total and unconditional obedience. Evil watches, and My angels remain beside each one of you, My faithful. I remain in everything; My Essence, My Germ remains in all the created. All that has come forth from My Hand possesses My Divine Germ and, as of today, you must find Me in everything, in everything created. I call you to offer, pray, bend your knees for those who persecute My faithful at this moment, for those who at this moment like sin too much. This humanity is submerged in sin and it is a plague that runs, day to day, monopolizing more and more of My children; but you, My People, possess the strength of millions. The only deterrents you possess at this instant are the lingering feelings of that I, of that human egoism that resists being totally annulled, to forget about what it wants, what it likes and totally give itself over to My Will, where it will find pure joy, pure happiness, since when living submerged in My Will, everything else does not exist and all that occurs is happiness, because it is a donation, a fusion at the same time, of the soul with its Creator. May I see each one of you reborn in the Manger this December 24th, may I see you there totally annulled and committed to My Will, and may each one of you give Me the gift that as Father I desire that each one of you say to Me, ‘Fiat Pater’ ‘Fiat Voluntas Tua,’ ‘Your Will be done Father, not mine.’ I love you; My People and it is for this reason that today I speak to you firmly but with merciful love. I have spoken with you today with the Heart of a Father, because you are My Treasure, you are the apple of My Eye, you are My Hope, you are testimony that I exist and that I give Myself to man. You are testimony that I protect and take care of those who are Mine. I bless your being; the family in general. I bless you and fortify you so that you may continue this mission that each one of you possesses as child of My Church. I bless you, so that in obedience you walk being faithful to My call. Do not forget, children, live in that Virginal Maternal Womb! And nourish yourselves of that purity, of that holy Tabernacle that is the Mother of all men. I love you; you are My Treasure, you are My very Love. Remain in the peace of Our Trinity. My House remains beside you, it protects you, it defends you and saves you. Note: Upon the ending of the message, we humbly asked the Lord for a confirmation of His Word and He gently indicated to us Psalm 144 in the Sacred Scripture which begins thus: ‘Blessed be the Lord, my Rock…’ ",,,,,,,
2009,12,7,Holy Mary,December,"Dearly beloved children of My Immaculate Heart, every one of you makes My Heart beat; you are My children, and I love you infinitely. I protect you constantly, I guide every one by the correct path towards My Son, but some do not accept My guidance and take short paths, which only causes them to be precipitated into the abyss and this brings them suffering and takes them by very difficult paths, ones that at first seem to offer happiness, but in reality, only cause damnation. Beloved children; I call you so much to remain vigilant and you do not listen to My calls! You walk aimlessly, like children without a Mother, in search of help, and you constantly stumble without being aware of it. You stumble with the devil, who dressed in a thousand attractive ways, begins his work on children, destroying love, purity, innocence, faith. This is the reason for which today adolescents, the youth, are everyday more lost and sunk in satisfying their own interests, whims, without attending to reasons; they have come to despise life itself. This is the reason for My constant calls, since those that grow up today, will hand over My Son’s Church into the hands of the one who comes to usurp Peter’s Throne. Today I call the fathers and mothers of families, so that they promote love for God, faith, love of neighbour. Today I call you once again, knowing that those who listen to My calls are the same ones, are the persevering. You My beloved children, maintain this Mother alerting all of humanity, you with your prayers, supplications, petitions, offerings for humanity, you keep Me alerting all over the world, in diverse places, before the imminence of the events you are already living. There are those who neglect My calls, proclaiming aloud the Divine Mercy, and it is so, the Divine Mercy is infinite, but you turn to it without wishes for change, without true Repentance, and in its place, you allow wickedness to grow in your heart, counting on having time to solicit God’s forgiveness. Little children, evil has taken on body, mind, evil moves, evil walks, and with greater speed has attracted a Warning that will come over humanity. I call, but man pays no heed, a sign will have to come from on high so that you see your interior, the spiritual state in which you live. It will be painful, extremely painful, only that afterwards, the majority will return to their state of sin and the Divine Mercy will again be obligated to look upon humanity once more in order to save more souls. Little children, alert the People of God, raise your voice, because man will go through dark days, of great tribulation, in which even though you wish to see the light, you will not be able to see it. I call you to make a stop on the path. Reflect, change, I do not speak to you to cause you fear, this is the reason for which I mention to you that those who do not listen My calls today, will raise their voice tomorrow crying for forgiveness. I am Mother and I love you, turn to My Son, He waits for you, He loves you. Turn to the Sacrament of Reconciliation, especially on the day in which the Church celebrates My Immaculate Conception, so that united we may proclaim once again the greatness of God’s forgiveness. I call you today to fill your hands with good works, because everyone has in their hand their own measure, and this should be presented before the one who is master of Heaven and earth. I am mother of all of humanity, do not fear, heed my calls. I love you. Mother Mary.",,,,,,,
2009,12,25,Jesus Christ,December,"My beloved People, yes, I have been born, but not for all My children. Yes, I have been born, but I am forgotten. Yes, I have been born, but I am despised. Yes, I have been born, but abandoned. How many doors continue to close, when My Mother calls for you to let us enter! Children, with such ease you leave Me by the wayside in order to continue to be submerged in sin. You use Me as a pretext; you celebrate My Birth in the midst of vices and consumerism, without dedicating a moment to prayer so that you may be closer to Me. The human heart beats, not in unison with Mine, but rather for unmeasured pleasure, without attending My requests, on the contrary, you live giving yourselves over into the hands of Satan. In these previous months I have called you insistently to prepare yourselves, to change your attitude before the imminent fulfilment of the prophecies; but My people continue to wander through the desert of sin and alluding My Mercy with ease, you deny aloud, not only My Words, but you persecute Me without respite. I am not the punisher, it is humanity who brings the result of its harmful behaviour upon itself, ‘evil claims its booty,’ My Mercy alerts you without ceasing, but I am not heeded; I live forgotten and despised. Each day at some moment you look at yourselves in the mirror, and it reflects an image that each of you wishes to see at your convenience. You will see yourselves before the true mirror, before the personal truth, before your own behaviour, before the refusals of My Love, before the spitting and blasphemies that you have uttered, before the refusals of My Mother’s calls and love. Yes, little children; the mirror of your life will be before each one of you, and it will show you the true face; not the one you wish to see, but the real one, the one that only you and I know. Today I call you to return to the correct path in these days that remain of this year, change the course of your behaviour and come to Me with promptitude. Do not fear to be different from the world, fear losing eternal life. Children, evil has designed a meticulous plan and you have fallen into its clutches, vertiginously living the fatal ending. Omitting My requests, you continue to give yourselves over to sin, and with it, to dehumanization. Children, listen to Me, I do not desire you come to Me because of fear, but because of love, and it is precisely My love that urges you today to return to the true path. Do not be indifferent to what is happening in creation, do not remain blind to the natural disasters, which are nothing other than nature itself feeling you to be indifferent to your Creator. How many calls Me Father, and in their heart, evil reigns! How many pronounce My Name and utter blasphemies with equal felicity! Creation claims Me, man despises Me. My beloved, I offer you My Heart, for you to take refuge in; in It evil will not touch you. I am the way, come to Me; turn to the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that the difficult moment that approaches humanity finds you prepared, spiritually fortified. Little children, come to Me. Your Jesus.",,,,,,,
2009,12,27,Holy Mary,December,"Beloved children of My Immaculate Heart, I invite you to fill yourselves with the Light that is born from on High, to recognize that Love from the Father, which His Beloved Son gives to all of humanity in an infinite excess. I invite you to house my son in your heart, and to pronounce that personal yes that transforms your being and will bring you closer to a full life. Nowadays man wanders without a course, he lets himself be carried away by the thoughts of the majority, and with pain and sorrow I must say, that the majority lives submerged in the multiple faces behind which sin hides. In Heaven the Divine Glory is sung and the earth is consumed in the darkness of the lack of affection and mercy; pride takes possession of man and is leading him to fall into all kinds of idolatries. Egoism grows and human beings lose their humility, so much so that they look upon the crime of abortion, which blackens the soul, with indifference. This slaughter of innocents causes all of creation to react against man and look upon him with great indifference. Beloved children, the earth groans because of the sin that man himself deposits over her; this is yet another reason for which creation rebels, and wishes to purify itself, in order to be pleasing to its Creator and in this purification, man will suffer, he will suffer. I call you to unite in a single voice of prayer that intercedes for all those who do not pray, for all those who do not supplicate; so that you may be a living testimony of my son’s love, and you make reparation for the pain that those who do not recognize him as their lord cause him. Man hears My calls and considers them to be a fable in which untrue stories, products of fiction, are told. What a sorrow! Constantly time and time again, without tiring, I call you to conversion, I invite you to be conscious of the hard reality in which you live and of the pain that humanity will face in general by giving itself over into the hands of the antichrist, who slyly keeps you submerged in sin, which grows in all its aspects. Incredulous humanity! Turn your gaze to reality; wake up, wake up, do not sleep, for He who sees it all is coming soon, He who knows you from your bowels, the One from whom you cannot hide anything. React! He who made you, claims you; do not give yourself over into enemy hands that confuse you with false promises, they blind you so that you do not see the Light, and invade your heart to make it stone. How many tears I shed for each one of you, for the offenses with which you injure My Son’s Heart! I alert everyone around the world, but you remain blind of your own free will and it is that the infernal enemy attacks man with fury in this final time taking advantage of human pride, sexual debauchery and the scorn with which the gift of life is seen. Sodom and Gomorrah punished themselves; sin continued to grow until it surpassed all limits. Today man does not see the sin in his behaviour, but feels it to be natural, this being a very serious offense towards My Son. The mundane is looked upon with idolatry, My Son is despised. Beloved, come to my heart, stop, it is not the time for you to continue to deny yourselves salvation. I will guide you towards My Son, only allow Me to take you by the hand and let us walk towards true happiness. Today I call you once again to stop on the path. Time has run out and the fulfilment of all I have announced to you by the mercy of God is before humanity; the signs do not wait, but you do not want to see them. In these days, as the coming year approaches, sin overly abounds; this is why I call you, little children, not only to make reparation but to invite your brothers to come away from sin. I invite you to initiate as of today an act to make amends to my son’s heart with the praying of the holy rosary, the weapon with which evil is driven away. Turn to the Divine Mercy. Before the Divine Love there is not a truly repentant sinner who does not receive forgiveness for his sins, but it is man who must take this initiative. Now! My Son seeks you tirelessly. Respond, children, respond. I love you. Mother Mary. Maranatha come, Lord Jesus.",,,,,,,
