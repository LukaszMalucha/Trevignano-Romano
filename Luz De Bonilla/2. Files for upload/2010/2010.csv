2010,1,6,Jesus Christ,January,"My dearly beloved people, come to me, children, come to me! With the love of a father, I maintain you in the palm of my hands, I protect you from evil, you are my treasure. Only it is the responsibility of each one of you, to allow me to grow in the human being. Beloved, today I invite you to come to me with the gold of human love, to give it to me so that I may be everything in you. I invite you to come to me with the incense of your actions, so they are not actions so full of human egoism, nor tinged with the mundane. I invite you to come to me with the myrrh of obedience, so you hear me and return with promptitude, since I maintain the doors of my merciful heart open. My Mercy is infinite and it will never close to whoever returns repentant. This is the principal cause of my calls. My love surpasses human understanding, and nevertheless, you deny yourselves the living in harmony with my House. Throughout human history, man has rebelled and continues to rebel, causing himself suffering and attracting to himself the evils that afflict you; as you lived it in the past, as you live it today, as you will live it, since you refuse conversion. Man, a divine creation, rebels and blames his creator for the evils man faces. I am not a punishing father, I am a father of love, of mercy, of forgiveness. I am a father who announces to those he loves, what is going to happen, so that his beloved makes a stop on the path, reflect and change the path; but humanity is not grateful for my calls and ignores them, accusing my instruments of causing fear. Little children, why are you determined to remain blind and not see the truth of my love, which alerts you so that you prepare, reflect and repent? Because, eternal life exists! Sorrow exists for those who deny themselves the right to participate in the Celestial Banquet! Do not neglect my calls; it is urgent that you change the direction of your course and return to me, so the evil one does not continue to contaminate you with every kind of sin and you are not easy. Pray for him. You are my people and I claim you for myself; move away from all that is sin, it is time for change, do you not see that satan maintains you in his clutches? Little children, each day is a magnet that attracts in advance over humanity what my Mother and I have announced to you for long years. Now you live in that announced time, product of the disobedience and debauchery in which you live. Man does not take notice of our requests and he gives himself over little by little to the enemy of my people, who will cause you to suffer, will persecute my Church and will make you experience terror. Time and time again I have invited you to consecrate yourselves to my Mother’s Immaculate Heart, to gestate in her womb so that her love surpasses temptation. My Mother guides whoever asks her to, by her hand; she is queen, advocate of men, consolation of those who suffer; she is my Mother and Mother of all men! Little children, I convoke you urgently, so that like those kings full of faith allowed themselves to be guided by the light and find me and be filled with divine love; just as they changed the direction of their course so as not to fall into the hands of Herod, so today change course and do not allow yourselves to fall more into the hands of the enemy of the soul. You quickly approach towards the moment in which you will see yourselves, you will see yourselves internally and will live the same hardness with which you have despised my calls. It will be an act of mercy from my House, for humanity in general. Beloved, prepare yourselves spiritually, be humble, charitable, compassionate with your brothers and sisters; be my very love. Little children, I love you. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,1,11,Jesus Christ,January,"Dearly beloved children, I love you; I love you and bless you. Today I come to invite you, to call you to my love. Love is not exclusive to a few; love is a duty of all of the children of my heart. Trust more in me; do not worry so much, so much about the future, to the degree that it hinders your progress. Do not worry so much, so much about what happened. The past is in my hands and the future is of my property. Give over every worry, all that perturbs you, all those desires, yearnings and worries, insecurities and illnesses to my heart and to my Mother; hand them over to me; rid yourselves of the worries, and you will see that I will do everything else in addition, according to my will. You walk en-route towards the final fulfilment of the prophecies, and with this fulfilment you should begin now a chain of constant prayer for the world. Pray, pray so that nature does not look upon my children indifferently. Pray to placate the forces of nature that wish to come out in order to manifest their power, to ask men once again to wake up and return their gaze towards me. I do not punish, I am love and Infinite Mercy; but man’s sin is so great, that now not only does creation rebel, but it vomits man. How much pain this causes our Trinity! How much pain this causes my Mother who received you at the foot of the Cross! man continues submerged in sin, and this has advanced the fulfilment of the prophecies. That is why it is of utmost necessity, that you, my people, annul human egoism and fusion yourselves with my House. I want, I claim mystical souls; souls, that even in the midst of the world, are not dispersed by it, and nothing separates them from me. Children, I want you to live in internal cloisters; that your mind, that your thoughts, that your heart live constantly fused to my House; that your words be praise and adoration, that your gazes be praise and adoration, that your steps walk in adoration and in praise. You do not need to hide from the world, you need to carry the testimony of my life, of my word, of my love to your brothers and sisters. Mature, children, mature! It is time that you mature, that you now cease to be dominated by what is human and instead, let yourselves be dominated by my love. ‘you live in the world, but you are not of the world.’ I love you; I bless you, and once again I ask you, are you prepared? Because the entire world will suffer. I invite you in the time that remains to preach my word to where I call you. Remain in my peace, your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,1,11,Jesus Christ,January,"Beloved children, today I invite you to stop and reflect; your country is a country blessed by my hand. It is in this time that I come to show you my Mercy, so that you soon return before this Father who calls you time and time again. Today I alert a beloved people, Costa Rica, so that it redoubles prayer -- for it will suffer, it will suffer. Pray to placate the strength of this country’s volcanoes. In this moment, you have your gaze fixed on a giant, but another one will also awaken and cause pain. Pray, pray so that nature does not see my children as indifferent. The whole world will suffer; just as Miami will soon suffer before the snows that approach. The temperatures in Europe will fall mercilessly. I warn China, the world is going to suffer more. Change, my children; the return of the greatest number of souls to my House is pressing. My Mercy cries out to you. You are my treasure, and I come for you, receive me with love and repentance. Remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,1,31,Holy Mary,January,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I love you and intercede constantly for each one of you. You continue on the path, in the midst of the harsh sun of the mundane which little by little secretly intrudes into the heart of those who are mine, with the end of distancing you from the true path. This harshness that enters the human heart is the work of satan to desensitize every human being and in this way lead you to see one another with lack of affection, to see your brother or sister as an enemy, as nothing, to live with egoism so that love is eliminated from the human being. In this manner, the enemy of humanity will have the great opportunity he has waited for and through deception encourage man to fight for personal survival without fear of causing others harm. Beloved children, when love is exiled, man falls to his lowest instincts; when love is exiled, man is left at the mercy of satan, this is the reason for which today, once again, I call you to not allow love to become distanced from your being; love towards God and neighbour must prevail today more than at any another moment, because satan has prepared his legions to act against humanity, with deceits. This is the time that has been announced, this is the time in which man’s enemy is throwing his poisonous darts to make your heart ill, blind you and present himself as the great saviour, the awaited one, before a confused humanity, because it has expelled God from its heart. The events of nature cause pain and death, hopelessness and distrust; this is and will be used by the enemy to get rid of the faith in the Divine Mercy, getting man to easily forget that we have beseeched a change in behaviour. My Son has called you to consecrate yourselves to my Heart, so that in this way you allow me to guide you like the Mother that I am, of each one of you. Little children, you are living what has been announced, and already hopelessness reigns in the being of a great majority of my children. This is the moment in which you must reaffirm yourselves in faith, trust in the Divine Mercy, in the divine omnipotence; trust that a Father does not abandon his own, but at the same time, the children must seek the Father. Little children, turn to the sacrament of reconciliation, turn to the Eucharistic nourishment, so faith does not deteriorate but is strengthened; turn to this Mother who loves you, ask for the protection of your companions the angels, ask for the intercession of the saints, constantly invoke God’s holy name; live a true life in communion with my Son, so that the enemy does not make you easy prey. Beloved of my heart, do not remain dazed by the mundane, make a stop on the path and see the signs that heaven sends you; see how nature is not the same, how it has changed, announcing to man that difficult moments approach for all of humanity, and with so much frequency, that you will not have time to help one another. Beloved, invoke the Name of God, and nourish yourselves with the Eucharistic Bread; feed yourselves with the body and blood of my Son, that way you will not stagger. Remain firm in faith and pray continually. The life of each one of you must be prayer, not only personal but for your fellow human beings, for those who will soon suffer nature’s attacks, for those who give themselves over into the hands of evil. Oh humanity, oh humanity! You do not listen to this Mother’s outcry! You, children, who live interceding for your brothers and sisters do not decline in prayer, increase it with worldwide chains of the Holy Rosary, so that this clamour rises up to the throne of the most holy Trinity and repairs the offenses that man commits against his creator. Do not fear, your Mother is here, and I intercede for each one of you. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,2,2,Jesus Christ,February,"Beloved children, you beat in my heart from which you are continually blessed. Little children, this moment in which you live must be a reason for unity for all my children. It is urgent that you gather next to me. You are moving in a contradictory world in complete convulsion; where lack of affection, violence and scorn towards all that represents me prevail, for evil has produced roots and is tying down humanity more every day through sin and pride. I am father of love, I am Infinite Mercy; but deaf ears do not hear me, sin has blinded you, words are uttered to injure me, hands rise up to cheer the false idols that are increasing among men who seek to satisfy their heart with mundane satisfactions, full of vices. Time and time again, I will call you to return to the path of eternal life, of reconciliation, unity, mercy, hope, faith; and you will attain this by accepting me as king and lord so that my divine light disperses the darkness in which the world lies in at this moment. Children, do not continue to deny yourselves salvation, do not live in the darkness of sin which superabounds. You who pay heed to my calls, must mitigate the strength of sin, by multiplying your commitment in the name of all your brothers and sisters, by being true testimonies of those who live in me. Sickening sin offends all that has been created by my father’s hand; man is indifferent to creation, and creation claims to the creator’s hand. For so much, creation rebels against man but man lets the warnings nature itself constantly gives pass by unnoticed, giving scientific justifications in order to leave off to the side all that my Mother and I have announced to you throughout time. At this present moment, my children cry because of nature’s anguish, which desires that man image and likeness of God, return to his creator. But my own do not see, and each time you will give evil more and more power, until evil drives you to desperation. All that has been created, groans with labour pains upon seeing humanity’s destiny; and in that groaning, my children will suffer so much that they will live their own sin in their interior, feeling the soul tear before the offenses against our house. Every human being will live the product of Their own actions, as an act of my great mercy; but even so, a great amount of those who are mine will continue living their own sin. The light will come for all during a few moments, to free you from sin, but with my pain and that of my Mother, afterwards you will continue with greater strength in black sin, induced by the enemy that will control the weak and unbelieving minds. I invite you to give yourselves over to the loving arms of my Mother and mine, so that she may lead you to the promised land, lead you and guide you to faith that maintains you like strong columns within my mystical body. Today I call you to anoint the frames and the doors of the entrances of your homes while you pray the prayer to St. Michael and the ‘Magnificat,’ as a sign of presenting your homes and your families before my father, and you are protected living in communion with our Trinity. Thus, I invite you to maintain the necessary provisions, which from now on you must keep in your homes. Do not fear my beloved! Just as I fed my people with mana brought down from heaven by my angels, so I will feed my people in spirit and body, in this time. Turn to the Divine Protection with the praying of the ‘Trisagium’ I love you and bless you, my dearly beloved people. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,2,3,Holy Mary,February,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, Remain faithful to my Son’s calls. A Mother never frightens her children, but intercedes for them, protects them and alerts them so they are not lost. Thus, this Mother announces to you all that you must know so that you do not fall into sin, but rather you maintain yourselves alert turning to the Divine Mercy. Each one of you is a lamp that attending to my Son’s calls and mine, maintain the flame of the divine love over humanity; you are light in the midst of this humanity that is stunned by the diverse manifestations of sin, which keeps man living atrocious times that have surpassed Sodom and Gomorrah. It is because of this that I invite you to read about the end of these towns of sin in the sacred scriptures, so you reflect and do not leave the constant warnings that heaven sends you by the wayside, not to frighten you, but with the hope that you change in behaviour and action, and all that has raised sin be minimized by prayer and above all conversion. A Mother does not lose hope, but takes advantage of every moment to go in deep in the heart, in the mind of her own, because she does not wish any of her children to be lost. Thus, I do not desire that any of those who are mine be lost and time and time again, as many times as necessary, I will call you to open your eyes, so that you are not deceived by satan who subtly disguises himself in a thousand ways so that you live in his clutches. I cry out to the faithful, so they keep vigil, since at these moments, prayer is infinitely necessary. Everyone must be an intercessor for his or her brother and sister; pray for those who do not pray, love my Son for all who do not love him, and ask for compassion and mercy for every people and nation, for every man in the moments in which you are attacked by nature, in the moments in which you will have the blessing of seeing yourselves on the inside and in that way be able to beg for the Divine Mercy and return to the true path and give yourselves over into paternal hands and reject the malicious ploys of satan. Pray permanently. I invite you again to initiate that worldwide chain of prayer, which is infinitely necessary in these instants. Little children, use the means that my Son allows you in order to convoke this chain of prayer. My faithful, be the ones who are that barrier of protective light that maintains the divine gaze on the earth; be the ones who are that fishing net that obtains the largest catch, be the ones who are that balsam that alleviates the pains that sin causes in my Son’s heart. Beloved, you have forgotten that my Son’s passion has not passed, but stays latent in every brother and sister that suffers, in every mistreated brother and sister, in every offended brother and sister, in every suffering human being. Do not forget that every man is fruit of my Son’s passion; that is why you have the duty of redoubling prayer, of not depriving yourselves of the Eucharist, you must be a holy Church. Beloved of my heart, do not let this call of this Mother go unnoticed, this Mother who keeps watch over her own, and who remains alerting, crying out, gathering her own in the face of the speed of the events, so they are not dispersed along the wrong path. Do not forget that the enemy attacks those who are mine, seeks to snatch you away from me, and wishes to mark you permanently, to keep you in his dominions. You the faithful, do not allow yourselves to be marked by the lying beast, who hustles souls for money and power. Trust in my Son’s promises and in those that as Mother of all men I have brought to you by divine blessing. My hand will never leave you, but be faithful and do not hesitate, Be faithful, for the aid of heaven will not be made to wait. I love you; you remain in my heart. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,2,16,Jesus Christ,February,"Beloved children, I bless you. My love for you is infinite, as my Mercy is infinite. You are my beloved children; you are my flock and I zealously shepherd my own. I gave myself up on the Cross of glory for each one of you, so that in the Cross you defeat evil. You are my treasure. I call you to be aware of the instant in which humanity is moving; I call you to give yourselves over trustingly to my protection, I call you to stay awake. I have confided to you all that is going to happen so that you are not bewildered when the hour arrives; I alert you so that you change, because soon you will see your internal ‘I’ face to face, and at that moment you will be sorry for having rejected my Mother’s advice. Children, reflect on your life, repent and confess your sins, because you wander about wildly, dragged by the current of modernisms, which has even invaded my Church, confusing my people and denying the word that I give you through my instruments, treating me without respect and allowing you to be Christians without commitment. Today I see you thirsty and give you, my blood; I see you hungry and give you, my body; I see you overwhelmed and have taken on my Cross your grief. Here I am waiting for you; here I am, beggar of love who knocks on the door of the conscience of his children so that they recognize themselves to be sinners and repent. Humility my people, humility! In beginning this Lenten season, redouble prayer, turn to the sacrament of reconciliation, precious pearl that allows you to find true peace, the peace that the world does not give! Come to me, come to me; nourish yourselves from my flesh and my blood. My Mother has announced to you throughout the world, across the ages, what is, now, about to come. I do not call you by means of fear, but by love. As I gave myself up for you, so I will come with my Mercy to the interior of each one of you, and you will see your actions even when you do not want to see them; you will feel the offenses even when you do not want to feel them. It will be a warning, in the interior of the human being, you will be alone with me. This is the love of the king who does not want his own to be lost, and moves his plans forward. I have entrusted my word to you. Announce it to your brothers and sisters without fear. Today my people are a people of heroes, of the brave who give their life for me. My people know that they fight against the mundane, my people are captive and must get up. That is why I will not leave you on your own, that is why I will come and those who have not believed, will be ashamed. My people, maintain the faith, do not lose heart, for your Jesus is with his own. Remain in my peace, I bless you. Your Jesus Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,2,17,Jesus Christ,February,"My beloved people, once again, I invite you to remain in my love. Upon beginning this Lenten season, of penance, of fasting, of prayer, of almsgiving, of mercy, but above all of love and of conversion, I call you to examine yourselves profoundly without pretences. Today I call you, beloved people of my heart, to reflect profoundly in your innermost being, about those sins which you still commit with ease; I call you to amend them quickly. I urgently invite you to pray without ceasing, to be the intercessors of your brothers and sisters. I invite you to give alms to your neighbour, but above all to yourselves, yes, to yourselves. Love yourselves so that you can love your neighbour; forgive yourselves so that you can forgive your neighbour; my beloved children, you cannot give what you do not possess. I also invite you to be a single heart alongside mine, that at this time prayer be born from the intimate part, the intimate part of the human being. Fuse yourselves with me, comply with the Urgent calls of my blessed Mother and Mother of all of humanity. We alert you every day, because our love is infinite as our mercy is infinite. Close your eyes for a moment and open the eyes of the spirit and see my infinite love towards you and with that infinite love of my heart, love your brothers and sisters, forgive, do not see the small things, see the great qualities, gifts, virtues that your brothers and sisters possess. I do not see that which is small in the human being; I see that which is big, I see my image and likeness, I see the love that you have for me. So, in this time I call you to be my very love, not to remain stuck on the small details that detain you on the path. Today especially I call you to fast. Of course, I am grateful for the fasting that you are in the habit of offering to me frequently, the fasting from physical nourishment. Today I call you to fast from your ‘ego,’ from the character that each one of you possesses. I call you to dedicate these forty days to annul that which most stands out, that with which egoism rebels most within you, that which is hardest for you to dominate, to bend in your humanity, in your character; for hidden in the innermost part of your being is that which holds you back from fusing completely with me. Today I invite you to this fasting, to this fasting which perhaps will cost you the most. It is the one that will most bend you, it is the one you will offer me second to second, instant to instant, because you must eradicate now, you must cease to wander now in the desert you are kept in by that which is merely human. Get those idols away from you, caprice, anxieties, lack of comprehension towards your brothers and sisters, vanity, lack of humility, the idolatry towards that ego which still dominates your impulses. That is what I come to ask my people for today, the nullity of your human ego the total and absolute nullity. Beloved of my heart, we are living an urgent time. Do you by any chance not see the signs that I continually send so that you reflect on the proximity of the times? And what more can I do as father, than give myself up and carry the sins that you have committed? There in the garden of olives I suffered every one of your sins, every lack of correspondence, every intolerance to the errors of your brothers and sisters, every lack of humility, every lack of commitment, every spittle, every betrayal, I suffered it all, I carried it for love of you. Now I come, I come before each one of you to ask for love. I thirst for your love. My creation thirsts for the love of mankind, and this time is a time of mercy so that each one of you reflects and gives to me that which prevails most in your being and that keeps you distanced from my love. My beloved people, how I love you! How I love you to the extreme! And in that love of this Father who gives himself up for his own, I invite you to go deep into my merciful heart. Do not fear, there is no sin I cannot forgive if you come repentant before me. Nourish yourselves from me, from my body, from my blood. I will give you the strength so that you may correspond highly to my petitions. Remain in my peace, I bless you. Your Jesus Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,2,24,Holy Mary,February,"Beloved people; dearly beloved children of my heart, Today I call you to remain united, in the unity of my Son’s love. Today I come once again to extend my Motherly hand before each one of you, so that you allow me to guide you towards my Son. I am the Ark of the New Covenant. I invite you today to board this Ark so that you allow yourselves to be led through safe waters. With sorrow I must tell you that many of my children ignore my calls and it is already raining, it is raining. That is why I call you again to board this Ark of the New Covenant. In her you will find yourselves secure, you will find yourselves with strength to confront the difficult moments that are approaching. I call you all to live in unity without dispersing, without taking other paths, because it is urgent that all my children form a wall fortified by love, so that it is indestructible. Each one of you is forming that wall, and it is urgent that it be raised quickly, because I need my faithful to unite, and as a single front defend themselves from the evil that prowls around mankind’s every side. Without you perceiving it, the evil one launches malicious ploys, like poisonous darts, to undermine little by little the spiritual foundation of each one of my children. That is why you must be conscious that each one of you forms part of the mystic body and that each one of you is important within the total work. Today, here I am, before you. Come, trustingly board this Ark That has been prepared to be a refuge for all the children Who remain attentive to the calls of the Paternal House? Beloved of my heart, how quickly the events that are about to come have accelerated! How quickly all that is written approaches! And how I see many of my children with deaf ears, with their eyes clouded by all the mundane that prowls around them, because they have fabricated false idols, and these reign in their hearts! But you, valiant children, faithful of my heart, unite, pray, so that maintaining one voice of adoration to the father, you be the defence of those who still walk not knowing which path to take. Be the encouragement of those who at this moment are weakening because of whatever situation. Be the eyes, be the ears, be the voice, the echo of my calls. We have already alerted you insistently about the necessity of checking your life, and taking advantage of this time to correct your path and behaviour. Little children, it is important that you find peace in the sacrament of reconciliation; it is urgent that you be those lamps that remain lit without going out, without fading. You must learn to discern, and at this moment, my children’s enemy is attacking them to disperse them, because he knows that I have a great battalion of children who, with the weapon of love, warn their brothers and sisters time and time again, about the urgency to encounter their father again. I love you, children; I bless you. I bless you because this Mother comes as the Ark of the New Covenant, So that you come inside me, and in me maintain yourselves protected And remain faithful to my Son. I bless you. Remain in my ark, remain in my heart, filled with my love. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,3,3,Holy Mary,March,"Beloved children, today I call you to love, to the observance of love towards your fellow man. Today in which you fearfully look upon the suffering in various nations of the world, and with anxiety and anguish, you come closer to see the insistent calls of the Paternal House, eager to calm your thoughts wishing to know what was of no interest yesterday. Today I ask you, do not be indifferent to the pain of others. There is pain, and it will continue to spread itself quickly throughout various countries; they will see the signs of the times, from the most powerful to the smallest. Beloved of my heart, pain spreads like a shadow over humanity, day is no longer day, night is not night. The human heart has tinged itself with egoism and will turn against itself. Children, prepare yourselves, convert. All that my Son and this Mother have announced to you will happen in the blink of an eye. ‘lent is a time of purification,’ do not forget it. I do not frighten you, I warn you so that you remain awake, so that you overcome temptation. Children, turn speedily to my Son, do not wait for the events that have been announced to cry out for Mercy. You must be part of that wall of prayer that rises to the throne of the most holy Trinity, interceding for humanity. Man must change, egoism must be eradicated from the face of the earth. In moments of tragedy, human beings’ egoism shows through in all of its facets, pain does not soften hearts, on the contrary it sinks them more, everyone fights for their own interests without sharing with their brother and sister. My own walk from tragedy to tragedy, without softening their feelings, until they see themselves face to face with their conscience; then there will be lamentation, repentance and conversion. Humanity’s behaviour has accelerated the fulfilment of the prophecies and what was at the door, is now inside; sin exceeded the cup. Beloved children of my heart, pray for one another without becoming discouraged, remain united. I love you, children. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,3,4,Holy Mary,March,"Beloved children, until when, humanity, will you continue to be sunken flagellating yourself? Until when will you turn your gaze to your creator? Until when will you repent and ask for forgiveness? You walk blind my beloved children. My Son and I have come very insistently to cry out to you for a stop on the path, to ask for love among you, to solicit repentance from you; time and time again you turn your back to us. The scourges that loom over the face of the earth make you turn your gaze for a few moments; you show your solidarity for a few days and then forget about the pain of others. When everything returns to a state of calm, you continue to sin. I have called you to take my hand so I can lighten your walking, but you refuse time and time again. Today I call you again to change; I call you to repent, I call you to be love, I call you to send blessings to all of humanity in general. I call you to bless creation; each blessing is a magnet that attracts goodness towards humanity. Pray very insistently for the conversion of all your brothers and sisters. Pray so that everything be showered with love. Children, nature has been destroyed, impoverished, despised; all that God the father gave to man, man has despised. The human heart has become hardened; I have called you with love, but I am not heard. The earth turns at the speed of sin, man is marking his future. Nature’s attacks will continue precipitating themselves one after another, and they are nothing more than the preamble of the proximity of the warning; the warning will be the means by which man will make a stop in his walking. Beloved, all that has been announced, has been accelerated. Remain attentive, man will fight against man himself. Here I am before each one of you, inviting you to conversion. Little children, do not ignore my calls. Remain in my peace and love. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,3,8,Holy Mary,March,"Beloved children of my heart, Each one of you is special to me, each one of you beats in my heart. I call you to live in unity, to keep firm in faith, immovable. My words are not in vain; they are born from my Son’s merciful love for each one of you, before the urgency of this present moment. Little by little the cup spills over humanity, each drop is an urgent call to conversion, but my children remain submersed in the mundane. As a Mother, I call you to conversion, to prayer, in these moments in which the drops of the tribulation spill over humanity. Russia, return to your lord! There will be tribulation in Israel. Bolivia, look at me! The eagle that extends its wings through all the earth from its throne, will weep. It is time for repentance, it is time for penance. The water will over flood its banks, just as sin has spilled over. Men of science alert, they call man’s attention, my Son and I warn you; and we are ignored. Wonders come from God; they are not in the hands of man. ‘oh humanity, you marvel at yourself’. Children, I call you to live in love, in holiness. The hour is approaching vertiginously, my Son is crucified time and time again, the Cross calls the Cross. You seek salvation through the wrong paths, you cannot buy salvation with economic means; you find salvation in the Cross where you are born and where glory is found. Children, do not fear your brothers or sisters so much; fear yourselves, who voluntarily give yourselves over into enemy hands. Beloved, once again I call you to bless your homes, but above all to bless yourselves with a life of sanctity. Leave sin behind and walk hand in hand with me to eternal life! Do not enslave yourselves, free yourselves, you belong to the kingdom of God; that is why I come with my angels to seal you. This Mother warns you, because of love. I do not want my own to be lost; the crucible comes for humanity, before the warning brings you face to face with yourselves. Understand, my beloved, that time is no longer time, But quickly precipitates itself And brings with it all that is announced. Do not fear, trust that the fidelity towards the Paternal House will bring moments of glory for the holy people. The reward for the just is the splendour of the new day. I love you, children. Mother Mary Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,3,11,Jesus Christ,March,"My beloved, today I come to seek you! I come to call my people, so that they gather in me and listen with attention to my call. Each one of you is my great treasure, and I look after you with great care. Each one of you is a precious pearl and remains in my hands. My love, my Infinite Mercy claims you! This is the reason for which my House is sending these constant calls, which will not cease even in the midst of the great tribulation, I will not abandon my people. As father, I have guided and alerted my own at all times so that they prepare themselves. I have called you to prepare yourselves spiritually, turning promptly to the sacrament of reconciliation, repenting sincerely, with firm intention of making amends; I have called you to change your behaviour, to be loving and charitable, not only with your fellow man but first with yourselves. Children, you cannot give what you do not have. My infinite love for my own Will bend man’s pride at the last moment? This is how the human heart is, it does not listen until it has suffered most deeply. I am love and giver of freedom. It will be freedom that leads those who are mine to meet me again by the path of suffering; suffering that I have not brought down upon you, but suffering that you yourselves are spilling upon the earth. You spill the cup on yourselves, you deny my House, you deny sin, you deny my Cross, you deny my Mother, you deny life itself. You act without thinking that an action produces a consequence, and this consequence is now turning toward you. I see the scourges that are before humanity and warn you time and time again, and what do I receive in return? Irony, deafness, ridicule, denial even on the part of my representatives, who contaminated by interests, do not see reality. Beloved of mine, already you are living not moments, but preparatory instants to the encounter with your own conscience. My Mother has warned you about this merciful act of my House, ‘the warning.’ The conscience of those who are mine will be touched from its innermost depths, and the proximity of this has shortened time, as it has already been indicated to you. They make fun of my instruments like in the old testament. They ridicule, as they made fun of me and my faithful. So it happens, so it will happen. When you see with your own eyes what has been announced about you, it will already be too late, not for repentance, but to stop what you have brought upon yourselves, the great tribulation, debauchery, darkness, the storm, plague, suffering, cruelty and war. With pain I see my children be prey of evil, the human mind and heart are blinded by evil. There is suffering on the earth, the sequence of nature’s attacks is preparing you, and in this process, man will turn against man and will worsen the sufferings that have already begun. Today I come to call my people to intensify Prayer, commitment and love. I come this lent to call to you to unbounded commitment, like you have never done before. The moment is pressing! I love you; my love does not change. I gave myself up for you, and so I continue to give myself up in the present act. Remain in my Mercy. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,3,13,Holy Mary,March,"11,45pm. I alert you; I do not frighten you; I alert you so that you return to the sheepfold! Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I come to call you again to conversion. Here I am before each one of my own extending my hands out to you to shelter you from all evil. Pray without ceasing, do not be discouraged before the daily attacks; resist the storm, intercede for one another. Beloved children, do not resist, return quickly to the flock, ‘for evening is falling and it will soon be dark.’ My Son waits for you, his mercy constantly showers over humanity; drink of this fountain. Thus, you will find relief for every tribulation. Convert, do not wait for the days to pass; repent and nourish yourselves from my Son’s body and blood. All who walk the earth will experience suffering in the flesh. All of humanity will be tested in this present moment; the great empires will feel the shadow of devastation. The west coast of the United States, the city of the great bridge will suffer; heed my calls with urgency. Man’s pride is submerging him in suffering, arrogance is cause for weeping. Children of my heart, do not be indifferent to this request, I alert you so that you convert, before the trial arrives. Heed this call. A Mother alerts her own, she prepares them before so that they do not fall. Do not hide sin under the shadow of disobedience; do not blame heaven for what you have forged. I alert you; I do not frighten you; I alert you so that you return to the sheepfold. The fire of sin has been poured over the earth, accumulating within it; now it will come out and allow itself to be felt. Heed this Mother who does not tire of waiting. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,3,17,Jesus Christ,March,"My beloved people, I love you; I bless you; I call you again to conversion, I call you again to repent from sin and to return to my Heart. It is urgent that you examine your life, it is urgent that you confess your sins, it is urgent that you repent whole-heartedly and return to me. I have always alerted my people. In every moment I have alerted you before the events have come one after the other. And this present moment will be the same. I have marked the route for you, and you have gone off course. A great number of my children refuse to listen to my word and that of my Mother when we have alerted you about the coming events. Have I perhaps not warned Throughout human history when sin has exceeded the cup and man has spilled over himself his own purification? This is not another time, it is not different, sin has exceeded the cup and purification is urgent and imminent. I do not desire that more of my children be lost. Why is it that my people refuse to listen to my call and that of my Mother? Do you believe yourselves to be different? Do you believe yourselves to be Gods, do you believe yourselves to be untouchable and that sin can continue growing by leaps and bounds without my loving hand stopping it? Why do you not want to listen to my calls? Why, alluding to my infinite love and my Mercy, do you deny my word that calls you to conversion before the entirety of the purification comes upon you? Why is it that you do not pay attention to the succession of natural events that sin attracts upon humanity? My people, humanity will live moments of anguish soon. Every nation will be purified. I do not want to lose more children. Sin has reached its maximum expression; you deny me constantly, ears are deaf and sight has become blinded by the mundane, by the temporary, by the finite. My beloved people, so much sin has been spilled and is spilled over my creation, that my creation has already begged me to purify itself and I have listened. So, heed my word, I am not an unmerciful father. It is my Mercy that wants to rescue the greatest number of my children, that has acceded to the request of all of creation, which wishes to return to me and fulfil the purpose for which it was created. My beloved people, I love you; I love you infinitely, I love you infinitely; and today I call you to place, in a visible place of your home, my Cross. Do not fear, do not be ashamed of being recognized, because I love you and recognize you continually. Today I call you again to anoint the doors of your homes, for the plague is approaching humanity. My beloved, purification is imminent. The events that you already know will follow one after another. Do not deny my word hiding behind in my love; because if well I do not punish and I am love, I do not desire that my people continue in perdition, submerged in sin, without repenting. Beloved of my heart, I am love, my love appeals to you and my people appeal to me. That is why attentive to that clamour of those who are mine, to that clamour of my creation, I come again to announce that you will be purified. Sin itself has exceeded all limit and you will purify yourselves because my love appeals to you. Do not forget that my Mercy is infinite and every repentant sinner is welcomed into my heart with joy. Do not forget that you have a Mother that loves you and intercedes constantly for you. Take my Mother’s hand. I have prepared an arc for you so that you enter her and are led toward me. I continually give you my word to guide you with love. Do not refuse anymore children, do not refuse anymore, because refusal will bring more suffering to you. I forewarn you because of my love, I forewarn you because you are my children and I appeal to you; do not cause yourselves more pain, Being deaf to my calls. Today I bring you my Mercy once again; it is before you, take advantage of it because soon it will be dark. The groans, the pain, will be heard through all the world. My creation will weep at seeing man suffer, but my creation appeals for purification. Listen to my word; it is word of love; it is my word. Remain in my peace, I love you, Your Jesus Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,3,19,Holy Mary,March,"Beloved of my Immaculate Heart, I come to invite you so that you may enjoy my Son’s love. I guide you at every moment. Hand in hand with me you will walk securely, my heart will house you in all circumstances, be faithful to my Son’s outcry. My own must remain in this present moment as a family founded in love, seeing the essence of God in everything. Little children, your father is not distant; he is in you. You keep him distant because you do not seek him, you do not listen to him, you do not pray. You must pray with constancy, one day and another, so that you are heard, you must intensify the petitions for the good of humanity. Beloved, at this time God’s mercy is showering itself in a special way, receive it, convert; it is the precise moment for you to hand yourselves over to holiness of life. Today once again by request of the most holy Trinity, I urge you to unite in a single praying voice, the fire rises towards the surface, anguish will seize man more and more in the face of a faith debilitated, by sin. You continue your lives being hesitant, seduced by the worldly, you have pushed values aside. The return of my own is pressing, it is urgent that you heed the call. The earth continues to spin and the days to shorten, thus the announced time approaches; soon it will move again and time will shorten still more. Children, if a telluric movement causes this complex gap in the earth’s movement, stop for a moment and think, how will the warning be, how will the punishment then be? It is not the father’s hand that will bring suffering to humanity. It is not this Mother who will abandon you. I will remain at the side of each one of you without abandoning you even for a second; you are my children, my battalion, my brave, my faithful who will fight against the hosts of evil, until returning all that has been created to its lord and master. The continents will move again, the water falls, the water falls. Do not forget that as the suffering of this generation approaches you are called by means of the forces of nature for you to attend. Convert, repent, before the warning arrives and the weight of sin leads you to suffer to the core, tearing your soul at knowing for yourselves the Distance from God, the lack of love and the disobedience which you have lived in continuously. Convert before sin burns your being, sin has ceased to be ignored, it has taken on life, body and has invaded you. You will live cruel moments, gestated by yourselves, your conscience will take hold of you for some moments, which will be an eternity for you. Asia will be tried again and with-it humanity. Today I invite you to see yourselves without lies, to be honest with yourselves, you will not escape divine judgment, so do not hide what God knows. Be prudent, but at the same time, defenders and protectors of the weak so that with testimony you give God’s Light to your brothers and sisters, in this moment in which confusion is taking hold of humanity. I remain before you. My heart is open to receive you. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,3,22,Holy Father,March,"My beloved people, Everything that has been created has come forth from my hand. That is why it should not be difficult for you to be copies of my love. I love you, and my love remains alive and latent in each one of you. That is why, if you repent, if you fervently wish to be my very love, you will obtain it, for my gaze remains waiting only to see that desire in you. All of the cosmos in general, everything carries the seal of my love. The centre of my love, my very heart dwells on earth. That is why all that has come forth from my hand, continuously looks toward earth, expecting to receive my love. This is the urgency of the continuous calls. You, my children, must give love, send love, be love, give love to all that has come forth from my hand. The cosmos is thirsty at this moment, for the love of my people. It is your obligation to be instruments of love and of peace. Concord much dwell in you; the desire to be instruments of peace must dwell in you. All of creation has its gaze fixed on my children, expecting to receive that reciprocity of love. All that I have created, has been for you; and this is the moment in which you must return love towards all of creation. You must be intercessors of love for all of creation. You must transform yourselves into that constant magnet that attracts love, which is contained in everything that has come forth from my hand, towards you, and you must return that love towards all the cosmos. Beloved, at this moment everything hangs by a thread; at this moment, with a light blowing of my mouth, all of the cosmos can shake, and in exchange for lessening the events prophesied across history, in exchange I ask for a little love, and even so, my children continue to refuse. That is why today I have wanted to vehemently emphasize that the centre of the cosmos, is the earth. My beloved people dwell here, my image and likeness. And in you I should find my contentment. Soon you will turn your gaze towards my House, because of fear. And you will do it for brief moments, for instants. But then human egoism will return with more and more force. That is why you yourselves have brought the warning upon humanity in general. It will be a moment of great mercy from my House, but it will not be enough. The human mind will still seek to give these moments of my Mercy a scientific explanation. Then I will give you a great blessing, leaving a palpable sign of my Mercy, in the miracle. And to this also you will give a scientific interpretation, and you will turn against me, against my House. That is why I reiterate that I am love, that my love is infinite and does not have nor will have limits towards my people, but justice will come upon you, attracted by my people’s abomination and a punishment will come for all of humanity. You will live moments that my heart does not desire, you attract them at a great speed, and it is imminent. And to confirm my Infinite Mercy, I will send my Son again. I am not a father that punishes; I am a father of love, so much that, I have finely delineated all that has come forth from my hand, I have beautified the human being and the human being has acted against my will. Today once again I call my faithful people to be constant intercessors of your brothers and sisters, to constantly send love towards all of creation, even that which you do not even imagine exists. Beloved children, you are suffering sin’s consequences. The cup has been spilled greatly, and the hardest thing is yet to come. The earth hangs by a thread, and you know it. But the conscience of those who laugh at the calls of my House is lacking. That is why I urge you to double efforts and prayer. You have seen already how much the days have shortened. Time is of my power, and I make it speed up in order to not lose more souls. Everything can change in the blink of a human eye. Everything that has been created by my hand, has been weakened by man’s hand. The earth spins quickly and more quickly. Creation feels nauseated by man’s sin. My creation cries out to me, appeals for harmony with my House. This is the moment in which man must vindicate himself before his Father. But do not forget that my love is infinite and my Mercy reaches farther than that where the human mind and heart can reach. Look at me, love me, pray, intercede, for this Father loves you Because you are the creation of my hands. I bless you, remain in my love. I bless you, be filled with my love. Be strong, do not let yourselves be defeated by those who do not love me. It is your duty to multiply love infinitely, and pray and intercede, Fall on your knees, for I see you; fall on your knees, for I see you. Your Heavenly Father Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,3,25,Holy Mary,March,"Beloved children of my heart, you remain in my heart, protected from all evil. Be faithful to my Son’s call. Prepare yourselves, remain alert. Do not blink in the face of sin. Remain alert, south America! Your prayer must be tireless! Remain alert Europe! Your prayer must be tireless! Mexico will be shaken! My people, pray tirelessly. Sin abounds everywhere, the ridicule of the unbelieving will become weeping in the blink of an eye. Attend my pleas, my Son waits for you. I am here to guide you; trust, trust. The earth is spinning more quickly, and it will shake very, very soon; so much that it will awaken those who are sleepy because of sin. Remain united, do not scatter. Pray for one another, so that you resist the difficult moments that await you. My Son protects you; do not fear, convert. One is the Cross, one is the faith, one is the glory of those who remain immovable. I do not abandon you; you are my children. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,3,27,Jesus Christ,March,"My people, I call you to remain immovable, to maintain the reflection of my love in all aspect of daily life. You are my children; I love you. I love you so much that I hurry towards you, do not fear. Whoever keeps his path on Christian fulfilment without false modernisms, that child with a serene conscience, rests confidently. Today I come to call the sinner, the one that is far from me, the one who has twisted the path, hardened his heart, the headstrong. I come to offer my heart, my Mercy. I come to offer you, my lap. Children, this is the precise moment for repentance, for conversion. Repent, correct the path, allow me to shape you. My love appeals to you, I offer you my miracle of my love in the Eucharist. My people, darkness approaches. My Mother has alerted you about the fulfilment of the prophecies. In the face of the imminence of the warning, I call you so that you prepare yourselves. I want children with a humbled and contrite heart, Repentant of the evil committed and corrected, desirous of a new life. I am rejected time and time again; rejection brings with it distance. By moving away, free will is the one responsible for the promptitude of humanity’s suffering, on account of nature and man himself. Human thoughtlessness is a sign of the lack of faith, one day you glorify me, another, you crucify me. Today I see a devastated land, parched, without love. I see an earth that is losing its centre and its gravity without man noticing. Man founds his security on his feet that rest on earth. The earth spins decompensated; it will be beside itself. The moon no longer hides during the day, the sun radiates its heat with greater force, and in the midst of so many signs, my children pour their sin over the earth. The beginning of the signs previous to the warning is being fulfilled, and will continue before humanity one by one, just as it is announced. Wake up! Today you cheer me, tomorrow you do not know me. Man sins with greater intensity in this time than in any other time. Sin has let its mask fall. My heart aches in the face of the pain of those who are mine. That, which for you appears to be far away, is closer than you can imagine. Pray, do not lose heart. You do not carry the Cross alone, I carry it for you; otherwise, its weight would overwhelm you. Look at my Cross of glory, sign of resurrection, do not be afraid to come to me. I am the same as yesterday, my love does not change. I am love. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,3,31,Holy Mary,March,"Beloved children of my heart, I invite you to enter into internal silence, To unite as one with my Son’s passion. Penetrate in the mystery of love, secure path for all those who wish and yearn themselves in faith. Silence the body’s senses so that the profundity of that which is real, of that which is eternal sparkles in each one of you. Insistently ask for perseverance. Allow me to be your journey companion, teacher of the internal life, and Mother at all times. Every thorn that pierced and pierces my Son’s sacred head contained and contains the love for each of his children. Every nail that pierced my Son’s most holy hands and most holy feet foretold the coming events; but above all, the graces, virtues and blessings for humanity and the final triumph of the Church. The spear that pierced my Son’s side opened the spring of Infinite Mercy. And from there was also born the grace of the warning, of the miracle and the punishment, for the salvation of this generation, before my Son once again comes to you. The calm comes after the storm. I received you at the foot of the Cross, even though I had already gestated you in my heart, in every sorrow that pierced my heart. I live, I suffer, I offer and intercede before all the sufferings that will precede the great events that will happen unexpectedly. It is not a suffering without bearing fruit. The Church will triumph. My Son defeats and rules my heart will triumph, For that I prepare you and guide you. I come as Mother and teacher. The darkness does not remain; it is always defeated by the light. Unite, do not disperse. My Son’s army must remain united. Do not fear, I am here. I am your Mother. I bless you with love. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,4,2,Jesus Christ,April,"My people, human voices ascend on high that cry: ‘crucify him, yes, crucify him!’. And I am crucified in the slaughter of innocents, in avarice, in the lack of faith, ingratitude, insult. I am crucified with abortion, in lust, in lies, in the trafficking of human beings, in the hands that consecrate me in the state of sin. I am crucified in the hungry one, in the one who dies unjustly, in science that wants to equal itself to me. I am crucified in the cinema that ridicules me, in the technological advancements that rob the innocence of childhood And cause them to succumb to a fanciful life, until they believe it to be reality, crucified in the youth induced to every kind of vices, and more, those of the flesh. The false idols have seized the youth who do not recognize me, and derailed, emphasize their ideals in the way of life of those who give them shameful examples; I am crucified in the pagan music that launches insults against me. I am crucified in the lies that the powerful governors hide, and they are preparing an ambush against my Church, all with an eagerness for power, for power. I am crucified… I am crucified… My people walk, but without a course. The one who comes to launch himself upon my people is at the door, to take power through lies and deceit, ‘the antichrist.’ Scarcity will lead those who live with weak faith to take the wrong path. They will sell themselves and they will suffer marking their body for a little bread that will not satisfy hunger; on the contrary, it will penetrate entrails without finding relief. You live difficult times in which the wheat and weeds will be confused, and those sent by the evil one will want to lead those who are mine by wrong paths. They will rise up with false prophets to cause confusion, denying my faithful instruments, so they themselves rise up through lies. You my beloved, remain alert before those who proclaim false doctrines, announcing salvation. Be astute, discern. All that comes forth from my House, brings a union of souls, brings mercy; it does not bring modernisms, it brings the seal of my will and the good of all. The days of darkness are coming to the world, in which the soul will feel itself to be without my presence. It does not matter if it is day or night in another hemisphere, I will bring a great light from heaven that will illuminate those who sleep at that moment, so that they wake up, and everyone live at the same time all that is written about the warning. Eternal happiness is not bought in a test tube; it is bought with suffering, commitment, with faith, with love, with gratitude, with union with my House and my Mother, with faith. A people that walks, and its freedom leads it to find itself face to face with sin, and they do not recognize it because they are so close to it; it is…a people with a lost heart, it is a people that must be purified, so that souls are saved. If a child asks me, I give to them. If a child turns away, I wait. Only that time is no longer time. Soon the cases of possessed, of those who refuse life, of unbelievers will proliferate. Soon you will live moments of long confusion, of unforgiveness. But I must also tell you that the one who prepares himself spiritually will be elevated to the path of peace. He will find himself strengthened to fight against the abundance of satan’s followers, who will increase and increase and soon, very soon, the one who will raise up a false doctrine will appear; and with the bad behaviour of some who have infiltrated the centre of my Church, they will Debilitate it before humanity. My faithful will feel alone and will have to profess their faith in silence. My temples will be profaned. Children, continue to nourish yourselves with my Body and my Blood, so that faith does not deteriorate and my spirit strengthens and illuminates you; so that true mercy and humility increases among my people, and you do not turn away from me. Darkness will bring the vertiginous elevation of sin, and at the same time will confront man with his conscience, that he will not find rest in any place, because everything he sees, will speak to him of my love, and his lack of correspondence, his ingratitude, his bad behaviour, it will pierce his conscience. I am a good father, I love my own, I suffer before the face of the imminent. For that reason, I am here supplicating for a little love. Do not fear, my little ones. I am with each one of you; I will maintain you; I will nourish you. As in the past I fed my own, so today nourishment will come from on high, so that you resist. My Mother with her angels guards you step by step. Continue to be those faithful for whom I will come. My people, remain faithful, do not despair. Why do you fear, you who remain in me, if I have promised to protect you? Remain in my love. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,4,3,Jesus Christ,April,"Beloved children, my heart is open for each one of you. My Mercy showers over humanity for you to accept it. I love you. Man vertiginously moves away from me, and this distancing has worsened sin. Confusion looms over man and man dumps it on my Church, which suffers and will suffer until agony. These are moments of uncertainty, of foolishness, of disobedience. Humanity imposes upon itself its own cross. I carried my Cross for each one of you. I have resurrected but you do not want to look at me. Inconstancy reigns throughout the whole world, perseverance is not recognized. Welcome the Cross with love. Time and time again, I cry out to a man with deaf ears. Pain will continue to beat mankind. I warn you time and time again so that you pray for one another, but you will not bend until pain touches you. Today I invite you to pray for Germany. This empire will see death pass. I am love and justice, man calls my Justice. My faithful children will continue to attract to earth my love present in all of creation. Confusion will come quickly in unthinkable magnitude. You must not allow it to detain you, my faithful must not fall apart. Pray for those who do not pray, love for those who do not love me, intercede for those who do not intercede; be light where darkness reigns. Little children, I invite you to reflect on my calls, so that you see how everything is being fulfilled little by little. I warn you, because nothing comes without me warning you beforehand. Do not spurn my calls and those of my Mother. There will come times of lamentation in which you will be sorry for rejecting my calls. In those moments you will fall on your knees and I will be there with my Mercy to welcome you. With sorrow I know that many of my own will not believe, even when they live pain in the flesh. I will continue to be despised, until everything has poured out over humanity, then I will return as king and judge. I am not distant to my people. I love you, for this love I come to call you so that you return to me. Do not fear, I am love, I warn you for love. Remain in my Mercy. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,4,6,Holy Mary,April,"Beloved children of my heart, I invite you to commit yourselves to prayer, united as one. The strength of prayer is an extremely valuable weapon for my children, it is a shield that protects, anchor that keeps the soul in safe port, it is a walking stick to keep you stable, it is water for moments of thirst, tranquillity, confidence that increases faith in order to labour in my Son’s vineyard. Each prayer is a spiritual promotion that increases your energy, it provides you with vitality, it gives you courage in the face of all adversity. Prayer allows the human being to submerge itself in the harmony of the cosmos, and makes it so that man is the recipient of all the blessings that remain in all of creation. Said blessings remain reserved because they do not find mankind suitable to descend upon. Prayer produces that miracle that makes those blessings converge towards man elevating him to love God above all things and value heaven’s calls. This is the reason for which I constantly call you to prayer, so that obedience grows in those who are mine more each day. Little children, the armies of evil rush towards humanity; they are spreading over the earth like a shadow, and little by little they leave in their wake suffering, suffering, and more suffering. It is a plague invisible to human eyes, but destructive, and it is undermining man not only on the inside, but on his body. The cup will continue to pour itself out, slowly, but second by second. This brings closer everyday all that I have announced to you throughout time. Several colossuses will awaken in America. Do not forget that the fire is rising towards the surface of the earth. The dawn will bring suffering, tragedy, death; man will be moved in the face of man’s own evil. You Will see how the gall of human foolishness, egoism, fanaticism, will bring another sorrow to humanity. Evil is possessing those who live without love, and this lack of love towards God and towards neighbour creates egoism, and egoism, fanaticism. My people must remain vigilant. You know that it is time for the fulfilment of prophecies and these previous instants are labour pains, everything will be fulfilled according to what has been indicated, one by one, little by little. Little children, do not try to measure God’s time with yours; several prophecies can converge in a few days, since time has accelerated. My angels are prepared to defend my children. The moment in which each one of you will confront his own truth is closer, the warning is closer. Pray, make reparation, repent, convert; do not allow confusion to divert you from the path, help one another, remain united, do not separate yourselves. I invite you to pray the Holy Rosary every day. Do no desist, pray the Holy Rosary, do not stop on this journey of prayer for the Church and for yourselves. My children, be instruments of love that elevate prayers for all of mankind. Today I call fathers and Mothers to take up again the ancient and holy devotion of signing their children. This act makes blessing rain down upon them, and helps them on their way. The youth need to be blessed by their progenitors. My children are courageous. You know that I protect you, That I remain before you with my hand extended To bring you into me and take you to my Son. I am the arc of salvation. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,4,8,Holy Mary,April,"Little children of my heart, Each one of you is a reflection of my Son. I see my Son’s love palpitating and moving in each of you. My Son’s commitment is impregnated in each of you. I call you to conversion, because the Cross is the fruit of the divine love and it must attract you to be different from the worldly, which is atrocious, sinful, contradictory, deceitful, ungrateful, disobedient, egotistical. I call you because I love you, you are mine; I received you with love, I keep all of you in my heart, all of you. The earth has grown old and wants to renew itself. Grown old because of sin, which has caused it to rotate more quickly. Grown old before mankind that has led it to suffer, because it has devastated nature. If you as human beings, were subjected every day to constant tension, suffering, to physical mockery, to constant illnesses, your lifespan would be very short. This is what has happened to the earth. Man has abused of the goodness that God The father gave him in all that was created for his wellbeing. Today the earth is aged. Tired, nature desperately seeks to find itself again, to renew itself. It seeks the love that created it. It seeks its God. It constantly groans, and in each groan that rises to the heavens, man suffers its attacks. It is not easy for a Mother to tell her children that suffering not only watches you, but that it is upon you. Suffering is on the earth, and each day will be a wail; one day in one place, another day in another, until suffering is no longer suffering, but a generalized weeping. This will be a product of finding yourselves face to face with the sins you have committed. This moment is near, more than you imagine. The warning will come to show you the ingratitude committed by each one of you, the ingratitude committed against everything God the father has given you for the good of man the ingratitude committed by those who say they do good and have dedicated their life to take advantage of those who are good. All will suffer, all will see inside themselves; you will live the true loneliness unknown by every man since whoever says they live in solitude does not know true solitude, which is to live without the Divine Breath. Beloved, conversion is urgent, the desire to do good. The earth will move quickly. Water will fall upon it. The sun will come so near that you will have to hide from it. Oh children, why do you refuse to wake up? It is not easy for a Mother to prepare her children, but it is more painful to see how you are lost if not warned. Return to my Son, not out of fear but because you have made the hand of divine justice descend upon yourselves. Sin has found its satisfactions and now seeks new forms. An event will surprise humanity. Pray! Pray! Africa, will suffer, will suffer! Ethiopia, pray! Guatemala, fall on your knees! El Salvador, intensify prayer! Mankind, I urge you to offer the Holy Rosary! Trust in my calls, they are not to frighten you; they are the calls of a Mother that suffers for her children. Pray for the Church as an institution. I love you and bless you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,4,10,Holy Mary,April,"Beloved children, You are my treasure, I love you. You are my children; I keep you in my Immaculate Heart. Purity must return to man. Submerge yourselves in my Son’s mercy. In this moment, so pressing for all of mankind, it is necessary that you turn to the Divine Mercy, inexhaustible source of forgiveness for all those who repent. Convert soon, before the wailing is stronger than the voice of supplication. Convert before every man looks at himself and sees his behaviour as if in a mirror that does not disguise anything, that does not hide anything. Convert before each one of you sees yourselves before his heaven or his own harmful behaviour. Little children, the lack of correspondence towards all that God the father has given man will bring more destruction. The sun star will cease to be so supportive of man its vibration will be a manifestation that will harm humanity. Natural catastrophes will flood the earth, which will continue to tremble continually. Today I invite everyone to pray for the United States, death ambushes it in great magnitude. Intensify prayer for Argentina, Ecuador and Czechia and Slovakia. The middle east will bring suffering to the world. My dearly beloved, the clutches of evil loom over the Church. My beloved peter will suffer the sin of others in the flesh. My Church is being undermined; in little time it will be greatly shaken. Faith must not decline at any moment. Prayer is the defence and the weapon with which my children triumph and will confront evil so that it is defeated. Darkness is coming closer to mankind. Terrorist attacks will increase because of human egoism. Beloved children, fear must not invade the faithful, my Son remains with his people. My legions of angels watch over each one of my children, they guard you, they help you and they protect you. Do not fear, you do not walk alone. Prayer is the greatest defence, it reduces evil. Do not decline in praying the Holy Rosary. Come closer to God, he is a loving father. I remain here, I am your Mother. I warn you so that you do not falter in prayer. You are God’s creation; you are God’s beloved. Live the divine love, devoted to the commandments. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,4,12,Jesus Christ,April,"Luz de María: ‘I saw my Jesus with his eyes the colour of honey that feed the soul and sweeten the heart in the moments of pain. My being, slightly fatigued by long hours of prayer in communion with my beloved, recovers its strength with which my lord envelops me and holds me in time. Now we are along, you and I, lord. With a voice that is strong, direct, loving but firm, he speaks to my heart, he looks at me and in his gaze is held the history of all of humanity. He talks to me with infinite tenderness and his heart overflowing with love, immersed on occasion with a sadness that he conceals in his gaze’. Jesus: ‘I am king, but I live forgotten by those who are mine. I am a king forgotten by my own, I am banished, just as you will banish my chosen one and will forget that he is my representative.’ Luz de María: ‘I know that he refers to our supreme pontiff perhaps because our church is crossing a painful and baleful moment, like a great dark page within the light that the holy Mother church radiates. That is why we are called to prayer, to intercede for him and for each one of us’. Jesus: ‘I have designated priests, prophets and kings; but they have betrayed me, they have broken, forgotten and profaned the promises of baptism. They receive my Body and my Blood with disregard, without awareness of my real presence.’ Luz de María: ‘At baptism we renounce satan, his works and his machinations. Humanity has given itself over to the enemy, to the deceiver’. Jesus, ‘they receive me without respect, as if receiving any other thing; they walk towards me and they walk profaning me. On occasions, they mix me up in their mouth with gum they chew insistently, or they walk towards me, talking on the phone, badly dressed and even more, in mortal sin. I love you; you are my great treasure. I have called you to turn to my Mercy, and with intense love I receive those who come repentant, but those who have preferred to hand themselves over to devil’s tyranny out of free will, will shake and take part of the justice that comes forth from my hand. It is necessary that man wakes up and undergoes this moment.’ Luz de María: ‘It is necessary that man drink from the chalice of his own condemnation. The lord has in one hand his love, and in the other his justice. Communion is no longer for a great majority, that intimate moment of union, of thanksgiving and of uniting oneself intimately with the body and blood of the lord. Now it is seen to be taken without respect, and as he himself says, he feels he is profaned. In this moment, our Mother lets herself be seen by me. She receives in her hands all the ill-made communions, all the ingratitude, all the communions taken without awareness. She takes all those communions -- there are thousands -- they are held in her hands like a great tower. She kisses the body and blood of her son; she makes reparation for all those profaned communions and disappears’. Jesus: ‘black gold will be a reason for pain for all of humanity. A battle for economic power will be waged. The great country of the north, in its eagerness to maintain an alliance with the majority of the countries of the world, has coffers that are very empty in this moment. Communism has seen this tranquilly, to stock up not only economically, but with unimaginable armament.’ Luz de María: ‘Communism is arming itself, it has bombs that humanity does not know about; it will be horror for all because of the effects they will cause man. The water will be contaminated, there will not be food, the earth will also be contaminated. The black gold is oil’. Jesus: ‘daughter, the climate will be unrecognizable; it will flog all of humanity. The cold regions will warm up and the water level will rise throughout the whole world.’ Luz de María: ‘I see the polar regions increase their flow of water due to the melting of the polar ice. Many islands disappear. We are guilty; we abuse of the cutting down of trees, we have deforested the land and have contaminated it’. Jesus: ‘daughter, the earth will continue to shake; it shakes before man’s sin. The earth vomits man’s sin, the earth is part of the body that is the cosmos, and this part of this infinite body is sick, aged from fighting against man. The earth itself wants man to understand that I am God and you must respect me. Man’s own pride will lead him to meet his own cruel destiny of suffering, of sickness, of what you scorn now. You will go from being men and women who are dependent on technology, to returning to be men and women dependent on what is rudimentary.’ Luz de María: ‘I see great cataclysms, the earth sad, vomits through volcanoes, earthquakes, plagues, some of them caused by man himself in laboratories. I see the cosmos; it is a great everything, or as the lord tells us, an infinite body, and the earth part of this body, is sick. Therefore, all the cosmos has fixed its gaze on us. The lord leads me to see, how all the scientific advancements will be exterminated, because of man by a great war throughout the whole world, they will also be destroyed by nature itself. Here I see the warning, a sign in heaven, admired people, some watching as if it were a show, others, recognizing it as the sign before the warning. I see the sun illuminating the Earth in a surprising way. I see a comet totally full of light; all the earth is illuminated. Here is where what we all know takes place’. Jesus: ‘my daughter, this is the moment when all of humanity must pray and intercede. I come with my love, here I am, to receive all those who wish to repent. This is a moment of battle. The evil one is upon humanity preparing its way. I come to call those who are mine to obedience, to love, to respect. Never, never will I forsake you. There will come times in which my Mother’s love will reign in every man they will be times of peace. This path is being gestated, but man must purify himself. Come beside me, remain thus with me, give me your love.’ ",,,,,,,
2010,4,14,Jesus Christ,April,"My beloved children, All of you remain in my heart, each one of you is part of it. My heart beats, bleeds, sighs for love of my children. Everyone, everyone remains inside of my heart; even the one who is most sinful, the one who is most sinful palpitates within my heart. Today I call you to renew the baptismal promises in a profound act of faith. I call you to pray the creed continually, so that you drive away the forces of evil from the earth. Do not fear, I am with you. Fear holds back those who are mine and at this moment, it is urgent that you do not stop on the path; that you continue with a firm, strong step; that you be brave in faith. Do not hesitate, do not doubt my protection. I dwell in each one of you. Those who do not know me, are loved by me. I seek you ceaselessly, and you I call to pray for those brothers and sisters who do not believe. The conversion of all my children is urgent. It is urgent that you consecrate yourselves to my Mother, but that this consecration does just remain an act, but rather that that act continues to be to act and behave in my Mother’s likeness, continually, in the journey of life of each one of you. You must be a reflection of my love, being living testimonies of life my very life. Today the shadow of death is traveling all the earth; little by little it advances slowly, but firmly. I see with sorrow my children suffering. That is why I cry out time and time again for you to convert, and amend your behaviour. Plague is approaching mankind. It is produced by human hands that wishing for a bit of economic power which they have lost in the last days, will cause illness upon my own. This causes my heart great suffering. That is why I alert you and again remind you of the use of the sacramentals, so that you protect yourselves. I remind you to anoint your homes for protection. I am with you do not forget it, do not fear. All that has been announced in the prophecies that my Mother has spoken to mankind with love, all that I have announced out of love for those who are mine, will be fulfilled by that very fact. It is imminent, do not wait any longer. Prepare yourselves spiritually, convert; live united to my House, take my Mother’s hand so that she guides you by the secure path. Do not fear, my House is with you to protect you; but everything, everything is upon mankind, so much so that all, all the earth trembles. Because of this there will be suffering, weeping and death. But be sure that I do not take my Mercy away from those who cry out to me. My Mercy is infinite, and at this time, it is showering upon all who are mine in a special way. An event of suffering will take place in Portugal. Pray children, pray; you my faithful who continually listen to my word, fall on your knees, in the name of all of humanity. I dwell in each one of you. Be my sanctuary, be pleasant to me. My gaze constantly remains upon my people, who I do not abandon. But my suffering and ailing church will wander again through the desert, without finding the way. Those who do not love me, are attacking my Church; they are merciless against her and will cause so much suffering, so much suffering! They will make her bleed and in my Church bleeding, my heart bleeds. These are the moments announced of the great tribulation. But do not fear, I am with you, remain on the correct path. Do not let faith falter. In these moments faith must prevail, confidence in my protection and my care towards my people, must not at any moment falter. Remain in my heart, give yourselves over to my Mother’s protection. I love you, remain in me. Your Jesus Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,4,18,Holy Mary,April,"Beloved children of my heart, My heart shelters each one of my children. Beloved, I invite you to pray strongly for all of humanity, which walks towards the encounter with its own lamentable destiny. My children’s behaviour should have changed in the face of the signs that are felt day to day. Through them the imminent events are manifested to you, which by God’s will I have warned you time and time again. Do not turn to my Son out of fear; turn to him out of the love that he deposits in each of your lives, although you do not want to recognize it. Life is a gift, and the enjoyment of all that the hand of the father created for you, should lead you to a totally different behaviour than the one you maintain today. This is the moment to give thanks for all that you possess, this is the moment to make reparation for all that you have scorned in life. This is the time of mercy and turning to the divine love will bring blessings for all. With sorrow in my heart I see, I live and suffer my children’s desolation. To those touched by the hand of nature’s disasters I say, I love you, I protect you, I help you and I kiss your heart to minimize the suffering of the tragedies that you are living. My angels encourage you, even when you are not conscious of it. How can a Mother not alert her children? If she sees them in danger? There are those who refuse to receive my calls, but this Mother will not tire of preparing her children so they pray and cry to heaven for Mercy. I call all to unite in prayer for the insular country, between southeast Asia and Oceania. Suffering approaches once again. That country is one of the most populated of the world. Pray my beloved; intercede quickly for your brothers and sisters. It is time for lamentation; it is time for unity and intercession for Bolivia, Spain, for the United States, Peru, and for Holland. Beloved children, maintain the love for one another; unity is blessing that minimizes suffering. You do not walk alone; you are God’s people. Be one, do not allow loneliness to penetrate you. My Son waits for you, turn to nourish yourselves with his body and his blood. Recognize that God is God and you, his children. Accept heaven’s calls, so that with humility you receive them and you convert out of love. All that you live and that accelerates upon you, is a product of the coldness with which the human heart looks upon heaven’s insistent calls, for the good of each one of you. The events will accelerate from today. Keep the faith, be reconciled. Do not let fear penetrate you. Trust in love and Divine Mercy. I am the Mother of mankind; I keep you in my heart. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,4,21,Holy Mary,April,"Beloved children of my heart, turn to the Divine Mercy in every moment. Do not forget the father’s infinite love towards his own. This moment is for you to live interceding for one another, and in that way form a wall that minimizes evil. The Church is living pressing moments that are increasing, without control. Man wants to control the spirit, and in this effort is attacking the centre of the Church. Only that he has forgotten that the Church journeys but accompanied; it walks, but not alone. The Church palpitates in my Son’s very heart, and it will triumph, it will triumph. Evil feels that it has power, and man has given himself over into the hands of that ‘malignant power.’ Mankind is at the threshold of confronting its own human sin. The moment is coming which no one will escape; everyone will find themselves before the infinite love of the one and Triune God. Every human being will see their internal state before the Infinite Mercy. Here there will be grinding and gnashing of teeth. Man will feel so ashamed for his sins before a God who is only Love and Mercy, who does not need to judge his children whom he loves infinitely. It will be man himself who, before the pain of the sin committed, will dictate his own sentence. God is love and does not punish. It is man himself who will impose his own punishment. Little ones, prepare yourselves; the advance of the events does not halt, it continues with more force before an inert humankind. Convert, it is time for conversion. Turn to my Son, he waits for each one of his children. Pray, in this moment in which you approach great painful events. Daybreak will bring suffering for some countries. Pray, since some lands that have already suffered, will suffer again. Pray for my children of Chile and Brazil. Pray for my children of Africa. Pray for central America. Pray for my children of the country of the north. The land groans. Pray for the Church that is scourged time and time again. Pray for all the countries that I have been enumerating to you. Pray for the whole world that will live moments of tension. Prepare yourselves, do not desist. Remain united. It is time to congregate in a single unity. I love you. Mother Mary.

2010,4,22,Jesus Christ,April,"My beloved, beloved of my heart, Unite, it is a moment for remaining in the unity of my love, It is a moment for being my very love. Everyone must labour in their personal field and be my very love. The rest I will give unto you. The enemy woks tirelessly entrapping the weak of spirit in order to lead them to fall into sin, in order to drown them in the depths of sin so they cannot get up. You my people, faithful people, do not fear, do not stagger; unite, form a strong wall, I am the foundation. Do not fear, unite; shut your ears to the entrapments of evil. Shut your ears to those who want to discourage; shut your ears to those who want to destroy my Church with vain and malicious words. Be an echo of my Mother’s love and commitment, through sincere prayer. Do not forget that the one who prays, cries out; the one who prays, loves, the one who prays, grows. Prayer is essential for you to maintain that unity with my House. Unite with my Cross, be one in my Cross. Be inseparable from this mystery that my Cross contains, mystery of my love for each one of you. Be part of this mystery of love, being perseverant, being true, remaining with immovable faith. Do not let what is coming be a reason to weaken at this moment, but on the contrary, remain firm and constant, knowing that I will never abandon you. At this moment you let yourselves be overwhelmed by the vicissitudes that are brought to your life by several situations that confront you. Because that is how it is, you face them so that you react against that equanimity and that faith in my protection that I have asked you for. There are events of greater importance that loom over all of creation. The universe itself is pending upon the earth, since you well know, as beings of great intelligence, that whatever event that occurs within the universe carries part of it towards all of creation. So, the earth will bring a great disorder in all the universe. I must tell you that an astonishing event will soon take place and will be seen and felt by all of mankind. Continue to be perseverant, do not lose heart in prayer, nourish yourselves daily with my Body and my Blood. May every one of you be a Tabernacle of love offered to me. I bless you. Remain in my peace and my love. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,

This moment in which mankind moves must not make you wait in order to return to me. My Mother’s calls are fruit of love for each one of her children. Our House continually insists so as to reach the depth of men’s hearts and move them to conversion, since without faith, it will be very difficult for my own to confront the imminent events of great magnitude that are coming. I do not frighten you. My Mother does not frighten you. As fruit of our infinite love towards each human being, we alert you. Our calls obey the proximity of events that are painful for all of you, which will cause great astonishment. The earth, man’s cradle, has been abruptly destroyed throughout time, and today you my beloved, have transformed its surface and this has transformed the earth’s interior. It burns from its centre, and man in his disobedience, attracts nature’s inclemency like rivers of fire that rise towards the surface. My Mother has warned you and called your attention. Her pleas are not in vain. The earth will tremble and again all of humanity will suffer for this reason. The waters will move, man will weep. It is time to pray and make reparation. Love compels me to convoke you urgently to pray for one another. I do not punish; I do not punish. My children flog themselves, product of their own free will. My children, return to me. I love you; you do not walk alone. My sprit dwells in each one of you and today urges you to conversion. Be faithful to fraternal love, so in that way you help one another. I love you and bless all those souls that labour without rest evangelizing to my people, making my calls known. Remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,4,27,Holy Father,April,"Beloved children, seven days spent creating all that exists, And impregnating each created thing with the breath of my love; And I gave the earth to man so that he would be happy And administer it with all that it possesses, for his well-being. Today I see that possession of yours, destroyed, in a state of chaos of which you are still not aware. You have abused of my love, you have abused of all that my love created for you, for your well-being. A people that has walked throughout history, time and time again, repeating its behaviour, purifying itself and again sinking in avarice and in pride. The love of my faithful at every moment in history, the faith, the commitment, the dedication of my faithful have been elevated, have ascended, have transcended the atmosphere and flooded all of the cosmos with love. But just as the love of my faithful has transcended and flooded the cosmos with love, so today I must sadly tell you, that sin has transcended the bowels of the earth, it has reached the earth’s centre and reverts towards Man. But the earth, seeing itself saturated and overwhelmed by man’s sin, today allows sin to transcend the atmosphere and leave her. At this moment the cosmos remains in an expectant silence. All that I have created for you, all the cosmos in that expectant silence, cries out to me, ‘our father and creator, cleanse us, since we are your property and do your will.’ And in the face of this plea of my creation, I, submerged in divine nostalgia, allow nature for itself to make everything return to the order to which I created it in the first place. So today once again I announce to you that this earth that houses all of mankind, will concuss, because this creator has heard the pleas of his creation. To you, my beloved faithful, I beg you to remain firm in faith, immovable and as columns, be support of one another. You my faithful, be those rays of light that transcend the atmosphere and illuminate the cosmos. Today I call you to submerge yourselves in that expectant silence, but without fear, rather in a loving expectancy. This is the awaited time, this is the time in which time is not time, this is the moment in which there is no longer a moment. This is my time, my moment and to you it is left to wait with patience, with faith, trusting in my protection, in my divine help, in my Mercy. Trusting that I will provide, that my angels, when it is necessary will feed you from their hand. Do not be frightened because my people are a people of heroes that have won, not one, but thousands of battles. My people are a people of heroes that day to day overcome the battle against the mundane, against the sinful. My people are brave, they have been a warrior people, they have been a confident people, knowing full well that each one is worth millions. You are my pride, and so I would wish that you would multiply like the sand of the sea, but for this fulfilment, there must be purification. Prepare yourselves, the earth will tremble, it will vibrate and cause anguish, but remain firm and light the candle, the candle of the pure soul, of the soul without sin, of the soul that wants to be better every day. Today I have come to seek you in order to bring you my blessing, not only to you, But to all those that read this word of mine of this day I promise to protect in the palm of my hand. I bless you in my name, in the name of my Son and of our spirit. God the father Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

And my response is merciful, merciful for the people that pray, for they find grace before the eyes of their lord. Today those who are mine multiply with their prayer, interceding for all that is happening and will happen to mankind. My Mother has gestated a faithful people, warriors that will remain until the great mission of returning my creation to me is finished. You who trust in my word, who obey, must be salt of the earth and light of the nations. My Mother’s heart maintains in each of her children, her very light, that indelible seal, which will protect you from evil and will keep you protected until the end. Beloved children, you have been sealed at the moment that you have consecrated yourselves to our Hearts; you are divine property. Do not forget that the just are in my hand and will be blessed, because after being tested, they are found worthy. Do not forget that the one who rejects wisdom and instruction, is unfortunate. Today I call you to make internal silence; A horseman rides upon humanity and a disaster comes upon his back. Remain alert, children, alert before my Mother’s calls. Do not reject them, heed them. My Mother weeps for her children, for those who for the majority ignore her love, and continue submerged in the pleasure of the mundane, which has hardened their heart, saturating it with false idols, exiling me from their life. My Mother weeps for her chosen children that do not alert my people, that deny my calls and deny my word of this moment. My Mother weeps for each one of you who devalue the present events, which are the beginning of the great fulfilment of the prophecies of all times. Beloved, every time, every call, comes together in this present. Everything has been permitted for this present in which purification will be the victory of my people, for which I will come with all of my power and majesty. Uncertainty is coming for mankind, the events are before you, sin is the fountain of each suffering that will make man tremble. Children, you are not alone, I have given you all that you need to win.

2010,5,3,Holy Mary,May,"Children of my heart, I cry out to every human being So that you continue that permanent prayer, not only with the word, But with a prayer of action, offered for all of mankind. These are not moments for you to be alarmed, but to recover lost time and retake the path that will lead you towards my Son. Do not be afraid. As a Mother that infinitely loves her children, I am here to give you these urgent recommendations, If my children obey, the harshness of all that is coming, will not have the dimension that accompanies it. If you do not change your behaviour, everything will fall upon mankind, with the intensity with which sin itself is committed. Do not blame God for man’s culpability. The Church will live its greatest crisis, order will be set aside. My peter suffers. You my children, accompany him with prayer. I remain with him; I will remain until the end. My beloved will not see the triumph of the Church. On the contrary, he will suffer because of the enemies of the catholic religion, which today are already led by the influence of those who are preparing the arrival of the antichrist. The earth will continue to be stained by innumerable crimes. Day to day abomination grows. I call my children to protect the innocents, to maintain adolescents separated from the contamination of the world, from communist ideas that emerge with force at this time with the goal of preparing their offensive. You, givers of love and obedient to my Son’s calls and mine, must pray the Holy Rosary in your homes, for unity in the family and to drive away evil. The awaited time has arrived, the time announced, the time which is not time. Already the warning shows itself, fog will cover all the orb and an intense light that will be given off from the Cross of love in heaven, will let you know that it is time. The sun will hide and the ardour that comes from on high, will let itself be felt by all men in the flesh. There will not be a place where you can hide; all men will see and feel the ardour of the fire that comes from on high. And they will also see their internal state. Do not fear, my children; remain on guard so that you do not fall into sin. Go to confession and repent wholeheartedly, So, in that way, I illuminate the way for you. Each faithful child is an apostle of this time, each one must be light in the world. I cannot speak to you in a more tranquil manner before this imminent suffering that approaches, I cannot hide from my children the suffering that looms over all of mankind. Yes, I call you to appeal to the Infinite Mercy And to redouble prayer this month in a special way. If you intensify the praying of the Rosary, I will intercede to lessen all that is coming. It is urgent that the echo of man’s love resound in each heart, in each home, in each country. You have the powerful weapon of the Holy Rosary. None who appeal to the divine help will be abandoned. I remain immovable here before my children, To defend them and encourage them, so that they are light of the nations. You remain in my heart. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

My hands extend themselves towards a hurting and suffering humanity, over those who turn to me, at every moment, I welcome all with mercy. My Mother maintains her hand sheltering those who are mine in order to conceal them from evil, and in that way, they escape notice and are not touched by the malignant one that at this moment roars against the small number of my faithful. Little ones, an event will surprise everyone. You will be astonished. The fishing has not ceased yet; today more than in other calls, I invite you to enter my nets so that I may take you to a safe place. The earth will suffer, tragedy will come. Where grace for the whole world over abounded, there will be a place of suffering now. The poverty of the human mind has led it to think that the one who possesses my land, possesses the power. Evil spreads, you will hear human lamentations, the earth will move again, it will be a passing of death, leaving the wake of suffering. Suffering that will physically burn within the human being, in his or her skin, in his or her being. This phenomenon, combined with an act of man against man will touch the innermost depths of those who are mine. Children, the clouds will not be seen before nature’s fury that will once again cover Europe. Chile will give birth to suffering. The empire of north America will suffer. It is urgent that Nicaragua make reparation. Indonesia will suffer again. Africa will suffer. San Francisco will not cease its suffering. Spain, England, remain alert! Costa Rica, the one that is has been sleeping for some time will soon awaken. The earth is no longer the same, the fruit has ripened. You allowed it to grow old, now it is rotten. In his desperate competition for power, man precipitated what has been announced. The economic crises will lead the powerful ones to unite, and later to break up, causing the war. My beloved, my angels arrived to gather the expected harvest; it has not been possible to gather. They have only presented me with a small number. For the sake of the faithful, my Mercy remains open at every moment, waiting for you. In attention to my faithful, I do not exercise all of my Justice, But on the contrary, I exercise all of my love. My children will be protected. My Mercy keeps you in a chest so that the events do not harm you. You are not alone. Pray the Holy Rosary, do not fail, be perseverant. The praying of the Holy Rosary will increase the defensive shield for each one of you, the shield before which the devil flees. Little ones, the devil is tormented by each hail Mary that you pronounce with faith and love. Do not fear. I keep my gaze upon each one of you. My people, do not fear. Your lord is with you! Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,5,9,Holy Mary,May,"Beloved children of my heart, I come to call you to fraternal love. I come to ask you to see the reality in which each one of you lives. The expectancy must transform itself into a loving conversion. The people of God will always be triumphant No matter how difficult the trials may be. You must not decline in prayer; it must be nourishment for the soul. Today, when the fog of uncertainty takes possession of the great empires, inciting with it the fight of the strongest, is when you must retake the prophecies and see how one by one, they are being fulfilled, so that you are aware of the agonizing instant in which you move. I invite you to prayer, upon the earth trembling, one of the great sufferings that we have been announcing to you is about to happen. My children you have turned over against good; and the consequences of your bad behaviour have been at every moment, self-destructive for man. Mankind is blinded by worldly splendour, that today is excessively against the catholic faith, which will cause a great Suffering for the faithful who will be persecuted without mercy by those who do not love my Son’s church, by those who have remained in open battle against the throne of my peter at every moment, seeking power surreptitiously, in order not to be noticed by the world. The strategies of masonry fight to bear fruit. I have called you to prayer so that each one of my children be that impenetrable wall that does not hand over ‘the treasure that the thief does not steal’ into traitorous hands. Rome is a sign of power, and for that Italy will suffer at another’s hands. My children, you punish yourselves; you have brought upon yourselves the plague that was announced. The human heart will feel great desolation. Men of science will be confused upon feeling themselves incapacitated to find a cure. They will realize that only faith in the power of God will heal this suffering through the sacramentals and indications that heaven has given you for such cases. Remain alert in the face of false prophets, who upon seeing the chaos subtly rush towards man. They will come to steer my children off the right path, confusing you with false messages. The devil’s partisans have let lose all the evils that exist and have presented them to men so that they fall into their nets. Sin’s booty is being increased, man, dresses inappropriately without fear of putting forth an appearance that gets him confused for a woman and so too woman dresses like a man and dishonestly, forgetting modesty. These are signs of the end times, and you let them go unnoticed! Today I call fathers and Mother of families so that they pay attention to the behaviour of their children and guide them adequately. All of this human disobedience, joined with mundane debauchery and to the constant scorning of heaven’s calls of love, are the reasons for humanity’s suffering. Until you suffer for all that you bring upon yourselves, until then, some of my children will retake God’s path in the final moments. Heaven weeps, and in this weeping will flood several countries that will live moments of anguish. Beloved, Pray for France, for Spain; they are your brothers and sisters. The sign of a Christian is to love and intercede for one another. Pray for Greece, faith is deteriorating upon seeing its fallen stability. My beloved, I have insistently solicited strong prayer from you, in a special way as of this month of May. Do not allow yourselves to live without Eucharistic nourishment, do not allow yourselves to live without prayer. My children’s strength is given from on high. Keep the faith. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,5,12,Holy Mary,May,"Beloved of my Immaculate Heart, Once more I remind you of my love for each human being. I still await the consecration of Russia to my heart in order to avoid the third world war. But you have ignored my pleas that would bring good to all, avoiding humankind’s suffering. The persecution of the Church faithful to my Son is worsening. There is opposition to my peter on the part of those who should maintain fidelity, and this predicts a confrontation known and gestated by those, who with the desire to unify the Churches of the world, are distorting that unity through a mask that the devil has utilized in order to infiltrate the Church’s centre and in that way undermine it as an institution little by little. Masonry and so many other sects in alliance with communism have planned strong strategies against my Son’s church, which are bearing fruit against my beloved Benedict XVI and will culminate in the already announced persecution of the faithful people and the establishment of the antichrist’s seal. My beloved peter suffers and will suffer. His heart will suffer in my land, in Fatima, I will make him see the suffering of what is coming. I suffer, yes, I suffer for those, my favourite children, who are not devoted to the teachings of the gospel. I suffer, yes, I suffer for those, my favourite children, that call my Son’s people not to love me, to forget that you have a Mother that loves you. I suffer for those of my chosen children who deny the existence of the infinite, in order to encourage licentiousness and the firmness of the devil’s power within humanity. I suffer, yes, I suffer for those who attempt against the Catholic Church to which they owe themselves and to which they have consecrated themselves. I suffer, yes, I suffer for all of you, my Son’s beloved people, because you have given yourselves over to all kinds of pleasures and idolatries. I suffer for those who profane and will greatly profane my Son’s body and blood. I suffer for you, who without conscience and confused by the malignant voices contrary to the Church that my Son instituted, will run after the great usurper and with him will usurp my Son’s house and will profane it. I suffer because you have not listened to me, because you have denied my calls, I suffer because they will persecute these souls that my Son has chosen to announce you of the word from heaven during these times. I suffer for this generation, idolatrous of carnal passion, distanced from the value of life, given to vices and darkness; I suffer for the uncontrolled fashions that distort the nature of man and woman. I suffer because my children are empty. You have flooded yourselves with darkness, which will soon come to fill the earth, and in its demons will rush against their prey. They will be moments of trial for my children, of suffering for those who have not believed. The earth will be transformed, it will no longer be the same. I do not speak to you of the end of the world, I call you, children of this generation. Communism has seized a great majority of countries, like strategic points around the globe, from which it is secretly planning its entrance, in order to demonstrate its power. Little ones, wake up, wake up, for all that I have announced is being fulfilled before your eyes without you seeing it, denying it fully, out of fear. I bring you the weapon with which I have interceded at all times, the Holy Rosary. Forge forward, my Son’s people, Each one of you, consecrate your being to my Son’s heart and mine! Pray they Holy Rosary, my legions of angels are awaiting the call of each one of you to protect you. Ask forgiveness for so much sin, repent, for evening falls. Live as my Son commands you, devoted to his word; mend your ways and change your life. Divine Mercy has no limits, convert. Come, allow me to lead you to my Son! Your Mother who loves you. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,5,15,Holy Mary,May,"My beloved people, I have given my Mother to you so that she calls you constantly, Inviting you to conversion. I have given you my Mother so that you turn your gaze inwardly, towards the interior of each one of you and do not deceive yourselves, but rather examine your conscience. In these instants in which scourges approach for mankind, my Mother does not cease to be that eternal pilgrim that goes from nation to nation, from place to place, from home to home, from man to man so that my children do not get lost. My Mother accompanies you. Why do those who call themselves Marian deny her calls? I do not punish, I love; love is divine property. How is it that scholars deny my calls and my Mother’s calls? It will be like in the past, the simple and humble of heart will be the ones who listen and heed the calls. Moving back in history, you will see how I do not punish or frighten those that I love. But yes, knowing the transcendence of sin and what is derived from it, the love for my children compels me and I alert you so that you wake up. My Mother warns you so that you wake up and repent; so, the consequence of sin does not contain the intensity that ‘man himself has forged’. You have been masters of creation, and what have you done? And even so, you want to continue to hoist sin after sin without being stopped by my divine love. Children, you must be healed; you must be healed, converting, before it is too late. You debate denying my Mother’s calls. Some disrespect her and others turn violent against my instruments. How I wish that strength which you use to combat my Mother’s love for her children so that they are not lost, you would use to fight and combat sin! The time of a new heaven, of a new earth, will come. I will come to bring peace. But this present time must not be used as a distraction so that mankind can continue to sin and satan wins more souls. You, children, you bring catastrophe for all of humanity. My love calls to my Justice, out of love. The opportunity will be given for everyone to see their interior and there you will see how many errors you have committed, and those who have power over those who are mine, will suffer when they become aware that they have been means so that their brothers and sisters continue in error. But at that moment I will be there like always, taking you by the hand and bringing you deep into my merciful love. My beloved, the earth will move again, the water seeks to hydrate man who is drying up because of sin, and it comes to seek him. The stars shine at night, astonished they watch man who no longer contemplates them; astonished they seek a humanity that scarcely raises its face to heaven. Soon man will raise his face and see that which he has ceased to see. Upon losing values, man loses the capacity to defend himself in the face of illnesses. Spiritual weakness has transcended to man’s body and will soon cause him to be vulnerable to several plagues that are already before you. My beloved, do not be discouraged before the ridicule and criticisms of those who do not want to believe. Soon they will seek you out my faithful, so that you go to help them in the midst of the fulfilment of the prophecies, which we have not given in vain for this generation. My beloved peter suffers and will suffer in the hands of those he loves. The Cross is made heavier every day by supposedly friendly hands. Heed the calls, take them seriously. Do not mutilate yourselves denying my Mother, the eternal pilgrim. I love you, and out of love I will move the human heart. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,5,19,Holy Mary,May,"My beloved, Today I come in search of souls that want to completely give themselves for their brothers and sisters, give themselves with constant prayer, without stopping. My beloved, these are pressing moments in which my Son’s mercy continues showering itself over all of mankind. He, eternal infinite love comes in search of his people, of all his people. Each difficult time for humanity is also a time of mercy. My Son does not punish, he is love. Man does not obey and forgets quickly, and continually falls time and time again into sin. In the same way, my Son forgives time and time and time again, as many times as are necessary if the child truly repents. I come peregrinating throughout the whole world, from soul to soul, knocking on the doors of hearts, so that you convert, so that you repent. There are those who deny heaven’s calls. There are those who, taking the infinite love of the most holy Trinity as an excuse, deny our urgent and merciful calls of love, in search of mankind’s conversion. Is it that you do not realize that at this moment so much sin exists that it has overflowed the cup, making it spill upon humanity? I appeal to all those who have in their hands the power and grace of reaching men’s hearts through the mediums of communication; to those whom my Son and I have opened the way so that they reach God’s people, I invite you today to call all of mankind to prayer and conversion, to remind them of my Son’s mercy so that they repent soon. But I also call you today with all my love to not deny the constant, insistent and urgent calls during my pilgrimage across Christianity’s history. From country to country, I have been peregrinating throughout history, because my heart, filled with Trinitarian Love, does not want any of my children to be lost. God is love and does not punish. The flood came due to man’s sin; the tower of Babel was brought down due to man’s sin, and at this moment many do not want to see that sin has already spilled the cup and that man not satisfied with sin’s multiform masks, still invents and devises new forms to sin because he is not satisfied, because he is not satisfied with the sin in which he exists at this moment. A great ball of fire approaches my Son’s church, it approaches the Vatican. A great ball of fire, of fire and anger, of envy, of vengeance; of fire of false doctrines, and of idolatries; of fire of denials, of fire of sin and more sin…, of fire of evil’s rage, against the one who governs my Son’s church. My beloved, The moment is crucial; you cannot deny what heaven Warns you and alerts you about. Do not deny yourselves this time of mercy for your conversion. Evil is setting a trap and is planning its attack, its plan of war against my Son’s people, against my children. This is why I will not grow tired, and even if you deny my calls, I will continue here constantly inviting you time and time again to conversion; warning you, announcing to you the promptness of the events, warning my Son’s people, which I gestated in my womb with my Son, these children that I have loved from eternity, which I received at the foot of the Cross, but that I already loved in my heart. To these that I nourished, to these that I suckled together with my Son, to those that I caressed when I caressed my Son, to those that I have kept in my lap when I had my new born Son in my arms. To you I call today to not stop, because the imminence of the events looms over you. Everything hangs from a thread and the thread is about to break. People, beloved people of my Immaculate Heart, take my heart, it is for you! Here I am, and I will be here until the end together with the triumphant church. Here I am, the pilgrim Mother of love. Here I am going and knocking from heart to heart so that you convert. Children, a dreadful evil is coming soon. There is a beast that is being nourished constantly by the evil of many men, a beast that is rising and comes to attack my children. Do not fear, I am with you, do not fear. My Son’s mercy is infinite and there is no sinner who does not deserve to be forgiven, if he sincerely repents. Steal heaven in this moment of mercy, repent soon. You live in God’s time, not in human time. It is urgent, it is urgent that you unite in prayer! It is urgent that you give yourselves for all of mankind in a single harmony of love in prayer! The sacrifice I come to ask you for is constant and true prayer. It is that fidelity of God’s people to the Church, in these pressing moments when time belongs to its master, God. I bless you; I love you. Come; let us walk together touching hearts! Come with me, with this pilgrim Mother of love! Your Mother Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,5,22,Jesus Christ,May,"Beloved children, my merciful love showers itself over my people. My people, the ones I love so much, the ones who have been faithful; For whom I come before it grows dark. I have sent you my angels, your protectors. I will give you my grace so that you do not surrender before the power of evil. I will remain at your side, beside those who suffer for my sake, beside those who fight day to day thinking that what they do is little. This generation will be a witness of my Mercy and of my Justice. I will not hide the reality from my own. Continue on my path, evil sets traps everywhere for mankind, which will face its great test communism has infiltrated its poison in the countries and now comes to cash in its loot. My own profane the faith they have promised me in the sacraments, and today they do not know me. Human pride keeps you in an unimaginable licentiousness, the senses are used in order to sin constantly by free will. You continually insult me. You deny my Mother that walks, you deny the pilgrim of love, you ignore her and reject her, ignoring that she is the one who continually cries for Mercy for all of humanity, and more for those who reject her. My Mother brings mercy upon humanity; She is maintaining the thread from which man hangs in this present. Mankind, you abuse me! Water purified mankind. Today iniquity is a shadow over man injustice prevails. This makes it so that man brings purification upon himself. Fire comes, and that day you will see how much you have offended me. The fire will enter through the mouth of those who have given themselves over to evil, it will travel through the body, they will feel themselves burn. Then they will blaspheme against me and they will give themselves over into the hands of the malignant one, they will be encouraged to sin more. This is the reason that in these moments’ evil is speaking through some so that they spread their errors. Evil hurries and places its fetidness in the mouth of the ignorant. Horror comes like a giant with a firm step. It will make the earth tremble, and it will make the waters move. All that approaches comes from man’s free will. My divine love compels me to look for those who are mine. As of today, astonishing events will take place throughout the world. I call my children to pray and to intercede for one another. My Mother walks accompanying you, calling you to prayer and conversion. Dearly beloved children, Pray for Ecuador, Argentina, Iraq, Pakistan. Pray for Costa Rica, England, Japan. The land of fire will suffer, I suffer for those who are mine. I send to you with your protectors, the spear of my word so that you carry it in your hands. They take the Armor of my divine love to you, because you are my great treasure and evil will not separate you from my side. I come to seek you, I come for my people. But first you will be tested and will suffer. Humanity will be purified. My love remains in present action come near, come to me. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,5,31,Jesus Christ,May,"Beloved children, my people, my beloved people! I keep you in the palm of my hands. Do not lose heart in the face of the hardness of mankind, which walks without a course towards its own destiny. Do not fear not being understood by your brothers or sisters, remain firm, do not give ground to sin. Move away from the worldly, do not be captivated by the supremacy of what man has created, which is finite and superfluous. You are my children, for you I handed myself over in order to redeem you and keep you beside me. Mankind remains tied to the worldly, you do not see beyond where corporeal vision allows you. This is the reason for which you do not heed my calls to conversion. You live attached to the worldly, this makes the correct path more difficult. The present in which you live is temporary, I bring you eternal life. Not in vain are my words urgent at this time of mercy, Of salvation, before the fall of day. Children, do not continue to be captives of the enemy of the soul. Mankind lives dominated by the spirit of perversion. This very high quota of sins spills over the earth that trembles From its bowels, in its incessant quest to be find itself in my harmony again. The prophecies have converged upon humanity in this generation that cries out to be purified. My people, remain alert. My Church is being undermined by the enemies that stealthily attack it, while you live without taking my calls and those of my Mother with the required seriousness. A cloud approaches man without you raising your eyes to heaven. Man’s fight against man for power will astonish the world. Terrorism’s crudeness will let itself be felt, immorality, degeneration form part of the acts that intensify the nausea of the earth that will continue to cleanse itself, and in this act, man will suffer nature’s inclemency through all the globe. You walk without obeying. Before so much denial, all that my Mother and I have revealed remains before you so that upon seeing your conscience before its reality, without hiding anything, you amend your life and save your soul. All that has been revealed has been advanced for the good of those who are mine. My people, you must counteract evil, receiving me every day, praying; and through concordance of life, being living testimonies of my word in everyday acts. You must make reparation for the constant sins nourished by a humanity dazed by the malignant one, who easily takes control of men, those that have become fragile upon living without me. You are my children, I love you, do not ignore my calls. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,6,3,Jesus Christ,June,"Beloved children, Receive my Love and Mercy. Mankind must unite in a single voice of prayer. My love does not grow weak. I will call you constantly, as many times as necessary, until my calls penetrate my children. I call you once more to live in holiness, fulfilling the commandments; living them with love and perseverance, being true lovers of my Cross on which I gave myself up for each one of you. Crush the head of satan whom I defeated in my Cross of love. Cover Yourselves with my blood at every instant, it is a shield of protection for my children, and that way you will repel the devil’s attacks from you, for today he confuses you so that you do not hear my calls. Love my Mother, be pure and clean of heart. Call her constantly saying, ‘hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin, Daughter of God the father, Mother of God the son, Temple and Tabernacle of the Holy Spirit. Mary most holy, pray for the whole world.’ Beloved children, turn to the sacrament of reconciliation. I wait for you to nourish you with my blood and body in the Eucharist. Be children of intercession for my Church, for my vicar. Children, these are pressing moments for all of humanity. All that I have indicated to you is being fulfilled; you see it clearly, but you deny it to yourselves in order to overshadow my calls and those of my blessed Mother. The devil and his partisans spread confusion, so that you give yourselves over to false doctrines and that way they lead you to the abyss, robbing you of faith through false prophets who will work wonders in my name. My children, remain alert to the signs, wake up. Remove from your eyes that blindfold with which satan covers your thoughts and hardens your heart. There is not time to hide the fulfilment of all that we have announced to you. Prepare yourselves; turn to my Mercy, convert. I come for what is mine. Love one another as I love you. I am here, invoke me saying, Sacred Heart of Jesus, I trust in you! Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,6,8,Holy Mary,June,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, Remain united to my Son, living the gospel, preaching with your testimony. Receive my Son daily in the Eucharist. Each one of you must fulfil their duty as a member of the mystic body, go deeply into the sacred scripture, live the beatitudes, be models of Christian love. Little ones, the Church will be purified, not destroyed. In the end my Immaculate Heart will triumph for the glory of the most holy Trinity. Unite in a single voice, with the praying of the Holy Rosary. At these moments it is indispensable that families pray together, so that they remain together. The devil is drilling the heart of the family in order to weaken you, lust will infiltrate mankind, it undermines the sacrament of matrimony and distorts the commandments of God’s Law. Perversion takes possession of man and the innocents suffer because of this scourge. Children, bless one another, Do not close your eyes without thanking God for the gift of life. You have forgotten to thank divine providence for all that you receive. You live with your gaze upon the worldly, you grow in egoism and pride. You do not look upon each other as brothers and sisters, you judge each other easily, with extreme flippancy, without respect. Like the pharisees, you condemn what does not agree with you and you let yourselves be deceived by the devil without perceiving it. You join with voices that cheer what is temporary and mundane. You move away from prayer, losing yourselves in a false reality, until man’s own cruelty will cause you to wake up. Mankind will live moments of anguish; war will bring suffering for all. Today I invite you to pray for south Africa. This your Mother, pilgrim of love, intercedes for all of you, when the earth will quicken its pace and time will shorten for man. Look on high, heaven warns you. See how the animals change their customs. They feel all that approaches and warn you, but you children, in the midst of your very hectic living, do not stop to see what you should see. The Church is being persecuted, evil approaches with more force each day, you walk in a valley of tears, yes, not defeated but guided by the Holy Spirit. Today I call you to cry out to my Son, Jesus Christ my king, be my protection, shelter me in your most Sacred Heart and protect all of humanity. Remain in peace. I bless you. Mother Mary.

Materialism and atheism are giants that have taken possession of man submerging him in all kinds of sins. The malignant one comes for his loot. Children, do not distance yourselves from the Eucharist, pray the Holy Rosary daily. Cover creation with my Son Jesus Christ’s most precious blood. Confusion approaches the Church, the faithful will live moments of great scourges. Remain firm in faith. The calamities will not be made to wait, my children will weep; suffering will be scattered soon. Continue to pray for one another. Pray for China. Pray for Indonesia. Pray for El Salvador.

Trust in my providence. I look upon you constantly to defend you from evil. Today there are those who claim to possess my word and are creating confusion among my people. You, my beloved, pray with the words that I taught you, Our father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Children, pray with my same words. I do not ask for great speakers or great words which do not come forth from the depths of the heart. I only ask for, truth, repentance, and a firm resolution for amendment. I am Infinite Mercy, there is no sinner who, coming to me with true repentance, I do not welcome with all of my love. Pray, prayer is essential in these crucial instants in which evil spreads quickly, undermining the heart and mind of each one of you in order to distance you from me. Pray, do not wrap yourselves up in the noise that deafens thinking and distances man’s heart from me. You are aware that in an instant like this one in which the earth hangs from an extremely thin thread, you must maintain yourselves fused in a single voice of prayer. Remain faithful. Even when the sun grows dark or shines so much that you feel yourselves burn; even when the moon does not shine and you feel as though you live in darkness, be faithful. You have the light of my Holy Spirit within, very deeply in your being, so that you can see what those who live in darkness will not be able to see. The world’s agitation does not allow for clear sight. My Mother calls you insistently through all the earth. She calls you to be love, as I call you to be living testimonies of my love and of hope towards all your brothers and sisters. I call you to turn quickly to the sacrament of reconciliation in which I wait for you to give you my peace, and so that way you can nourish yourselves from me in the Eucharist, in which I am present, alive and true. With love I call my ministers, in order that they speak with the truth, so that they transmit my word, so that my people do not continue walking blind and deaf. Do not use this sacred ministry to take advantage in any way. Be faithful shepherds and guide my congregation towards eternal life. Beloved children, every instant of the day invoke me saying, Jesus Christ, save me! Jesus Christ save me! Jesus Christ save me! In every moment of temptation, in every moment of drought, in every moment of doubt, in every moment in which you feel yourselves turn away from me, Jesus Christ save me! Be intercessors for all of humanity, remain faithful, for I remain in you. I will not abandon you; I will provide for all that my people need. Do not fear. Do not fear. I warn you so that you remain alert before all that is coming. My Mother warns you out of love, about all that is going to happen. Not in vain have my Mother and I prophesied all that is happening. This is the moment of the purification of this generation, a purification of fire. Instants in which water will wash the sin of the earth. Sin that my children have planted in the earth, sin that the earth no longer resists and cries out to be purified. You must not fear more, because I keep you in the palm of my hands. My Church will triumph forever and ever. Remain in my love, in my peace, beloved people. I bless you and I bless all your families, all your descendants and your ancestors.

My Mercy has not been closed off nor will it ever be closed off; I am kindness and forgiveness; my love remains before each one of you. Children, you have become accustomed to live being surrounded by all that has been created for your wellbeing. This is the reason for which you have demolished my creation, reducing it to a shadow. You abuse of my love. I am blasphemed, stepped on. You love what is temporary and detest me. You live in the midst of idols. You have furrowed the earth with sin; you will receive an excessive harvest of suffering, disasters and frustration. The earth will move, water is taking possession of it. You will not be able to be guided by the seasons. The sun will not be benevolent again. You live in the third lamentation. Evil moves with the wind, contaminating minds, weakening my calls, slyly deceiving you. I look with sadness upon this generation that coexists with sin in total familiarity. How prideful you are with me! My Mother’s love for you is divine patience which is spilled out in this my word time and time again. If you listen to me, I will be compassionate. My divine love comes to be reunited with each one of you. You will see yourselves just as you are, without disguises, without blindfolds. You will stand before the mirror of your conscience. Prepare yourselves for this moment. A halt on the path is urgent. I call you to pray for my vicar, with tenacity. Pray for the Italian peninsula. Pray for Mexico, the United States, Czechia and Slovakia, Hungary, central America. Do not forget Spain, a suffering surround it. I will come to gather a purified ‘new people’ In which I will be glorified. Children, do not let faith grow weak. All that happens is the fulfilment of the prophecies that vertiginously approach. My loving justice calls you; you are my children. The faithful, the humble of heart will be strengthened so that the enemies of the soul melt like wax before fire. My people, do not fear. I give you my support and the weapons, you are not alone. Jesus Christ, save me, Jesus Christ, save me, Jesus Christ, save me. Hail Mary most pure! Remain in my love. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,6,28,Holy Mary,June,"My beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, Every moment is urgent and should not be wasted. Everything is upon humanity. Every moment is extremely urgent and it should not be wasted. I call you to an absolute and total conversion. Your walking must always be a testimony of the true Christian who is faithful to the scriptures, the commandments, the sacraments, the beatitudes, devoted to the Church. Instants in which each second has infinite value and scope because it affects the instant that humanity has left. In the depths of the earth, fire is quickly preparing to rise to the surface. Soon you will see with astonishment several volcanoes that cause unimaginable and great pain for many nations. The water at the bottom of the sea, is becoming rough water in order to quickly jump towards the land, this is because the earth will move again and will shorten the present moment. You must prepare yourselves spiritually very, very well; you must no longer see the finite and hurriedly begin the leap towards the infinite, towards God. Faith cannot succumb, not even before the battles that approach the Church. Faith is in my Son Jesus Christ, not in men. Remember this, faith should not falter. Remain firm without moving; that is why I call you time and time again to be true Christians. Love the Cross and find in her that essence, which only those who go beyond what is merely visible to human sight can see. That essence of true love, of the divine love that is found in the Cross, this is what you must seek so that faith never staggers, under any circumstances. Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, communism has slyly seized nations little by little, and many of my children have fallen into its trap. Today I call you to pray with strength for my children of Venezuela. South America is in danger. I invite you to pray for California. To pray and make reparation for San Francisco. To pray and make reparation for Czechia and Slovakia. To pray and make reparation for the Asian continent. Beloved, the instant future will bring suffering, but you as faithful warriors, united to my Son's merciful love, raise your face toward heaven and fill yourselves with Divine Mercy. Maintain your gaze in the merciful heart and find in him the balm before all tribulation. You are not alone, do not fear, do not fear! The Church will triumph, but it must be purified! You will never be abandoned. My maternal heart shelters you all; my mantle of love covers you in all circumstances, but I need your will to come to me so I can lead you to my Son. Do not fear, we will triumph, evil will be crushed and you people of God will arise jubilant and triumphant! Keep the faith, do not decline. I had already invited you to remain in a chain of worldwide prayer; today, I call you for a second time to remain in that unity, in a single voice through the Holy Rosary. Cry out for those who do not want to listen, for those who do not love, for those who blaspheme, for those who despise my Son. Pray for the conversion of your brothers and sisters and you, who listen faithfully to my Son’s calls and my calls, you who do understand this extremely urgent moment in which humanity lives, you who do see, you who do hear the word of my Son, you who do not despise my calls, you who are faithful, double prayer through live and permanent testimony of the Trinitarian Love, of mercy, of mercy and of forgiveness. Be living testimonies of my Son's love, give testimony in every word, in every look, in every step. Fill the face of the earth with divine love! All that is approaching is not going to stop, but you can intercede before the holy Trinity to mitigate what is coming as much as possible. Unite, live in love, cry out, cry out by being a testimony of the behaviour of the true Son of God. I bless you beloved of my Immaculate Heart; remain in peace united as one. Hail Mary most pure, hail Mary most pure! Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,7,2,Jesus Christ,July,"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Beloved children, I call you; I wait for you. My arms remain extended for all those who come to my most Sacred Heart. They will never close. One by one I welcome you to harbour you and seal you with the indelible seal of my Holy Spirit that imprints my name on you, ‘Jesus Christ, save me!’ I am generous, I keep nothing for myself, I offer you eternal life. One word is sufficient to attract me. Each seed that you plant in that firm soil that you have ploughed with tears, with daily struggles, will germinate fertilized by my unceasing love. Men erase my name from their mouth. They have renounced fulfilling the commandments in order not to restrain free will and consent to the devil. For so much, therefore they will have to live beneath the devil’s tyranny; this will be the inclement executioner that will lead man to live horror. A light that comes from the firmament will bring you anguish. Man has raised his voice, then the moment of silence will come. Man will cause great harm to himself. The nations will give themselves over to the aberrations of the flesh, gravely insulting and inexpressibly offending me. The more you move away from my House, the more you submerge yourselves in the moment of suffering, from which none of my children will be spared. You will see my Justice next to my Mercy. I look with sadness and pain upon some who come to the temple to serve me, but with coldness, with hypocrisy. Only to keep a post of preference before the community. All that takes place is yet another call to conversion. I invite you to pray for the Dominican Republic and to reinforce prayer for the United States and Mexico. My children, I remained in the tomb for three days to then resurrect. So, you will be deprived of light for three days. After these three days you will shine as light that is not hidden shines. The faithful will be consoled; I will give you the shield of My love so that nothing can touch you. I present to you all that will happen unexpectedly, so that you return quickly before day falls and the lamentations are greater. Be aware that you are my children. You are the apple of my eye. I do not abandon you, remain in faith. My hand supports you, do not abandon me! Unite in prayer for the whole world. You are my people. I cover you with my most precious blood! Remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,7,4,Jesus Christ,July,"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Beloved children, My voice will not be silenced; I cry out for my people. I call you one by one. You are the great and irreplaceable treasure of this king. My love’s light illuminate’s creation. But it is stopped by the constant sinful acts of man. Each prayer, thought or act of intercession between brothers is light that fuses into a single lighthouse of reparation for all of mankind. This light maintains that thread from which man hangs suspended from his creator. Unity in man is necessary. You must live in my will, so that you maintain the human balance. By not fulfilling this mandate, you have altered all that has been created. The cosmos remains in silence looking at man self-destruct. The face of the earth is covered with mud because of sin. The succession and confluence of the prophecies, along with constant attacks and consequences thereof, will weigh on man’s journeying. You will feel as if you are wandering aimlessly. The earth will tremble from place to place. Water will bring more pain. My Church has been invaded; smoke of evil has penetrated it. Pray for my beloved peter. He will be cruelly scourged by those who have served me and will serve me without loyalty, allowing themselves to live in evil. Darkness will come for three days, surpassing the star that is the sun. These days will seem endless. Children, Love and brotherhood must prevail. Only faith, love for one another and unity, will succeed in keeping me people standing in the following moments of tribulation. The spectre of war rises quickly. Children, it is urgent that you fall on your knees. I invite you to pray for Brazil, Japan, the United States, Europe, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. The pain will not wait. Mexico, wake up! Beloved children, come to the sacrament of reconciliation. I wait for you in the Eucharist. You will be the astonishment of humanity, You will live from my will, without physical food. Remain faithful. My people will not be defeated, I am your strength, your breath. Nourish yourselves with my word, spiritual manna. My beloved children, I keep you within my most Sacred Heart. Remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

My angels remain on earth, protecting my people. My Mercy does not close off for those who repent and return to my fold. My love overflows in abundance upon all men, but few are the ones who open their heart to me so that I may come dwell in it. The devil furiously rushes against humanity, he penetrates man’s mind and injects in him the spirit of malice and pride, so that you despise salvation. The cosmos remains in waiting upon mankind’s behaviour. The wrong use of technology will be a cruel and black scourge. The spark of horror is about to ignite. The wind, which does not hold back, will spread suffering, it will burn man and nature. The desert will be invaded by water. Beloved children, from the bowels of the earth, fire will rise once again. Pray for my beloved vicar, pray without ceasing. My people, rejoice, my day is about to arrive! The fisherman will come and with him mankind will find itself submerged in its total purification. Man, dresses in silk and woman no longer procreates. These are signs of the moment in which you live, these do not wait. The blindness of sin has taken possession of those who are mine. Once again, I call you to wake up. Idolatry hardens hearts, the gabble does not last forever, you will wake up surprised. You do not obey this king, whose sceptre has been usurped, whom you forget with ease and offend continually. Pray for one another. Pray for Costa Rica and for Colombia. Pray for Argentina and Brazil. Pray for Spain, Portugal and Greece. Beloved people of my Sacred Heart, the path is one, it is drawn, it is ‘my will’. You continue to go astray, guided by free will you are easy prey for the malignant one. Beloved, use the gift of speech to adore me, to bless one another and to lift up each other mutually. Come to me, do not fear, my merciful love is for all. I alert you out of love. My people will live eternally with me. You walk a secure path. I take care of my children; I keep you in my lap. I cover you with my most precious blood! Remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

I house you here within me; you are my beloved children, do not fear; maintain faith, hope and trust in heaven’s protection for each one of its faithful. Man’s disobedience continues to mark his destiny, a destiny of pain, of suffering and persecution. The angels are waiting, waiting for the sign to lift the innocents when the tribulation worsens. Yes, my beloved children, the tribulation is a blink of an eye away from mankind. You walk in total disobedience, dazed by the noise that does not allow you to listen with clarity to heaven’s most urgent call. Man’s will once again lead him to confront a cruel reality. Man punishes himself. The disasters throughout all the earth are worsening, nature will soon tremble and man will bring pain by his own hand. Beloved of mine, my beloved saint Michael, along with his legions, awaits the signal to rescue the faithful people, to accompany them in the moments of persecution, so they do not stagger and faith remains immovable. You were sealed at baptism. Do not allow the malignant one, usurper of souls, to seal again what the eternal father has already sealed, what my Son’s most precious blood has already saved. You are God the father’s possession and so you must maintain yourselves in faith. My Son’s merciful hand is before you, before man’s will so that man returns quickly towards the fold. I love you; I keep you in my Immaculate Heart. The difficult moments, very difficult are approaching; prayers are indispensable now more than ever. You who do listen to the divine calls, you who do remain faithful and in prayer, you are light in the midst of so much darkness. You will be light even in the midst of the darkness that is approaching. The events that have been announced by this Mother are before mankind, which hurts and crucifies my Son time and time again. Everything remains before you. Those who do not believe, those who do not obey, will look upon the next outcome of the prophesied events with great astonishment. They will feel themselves go insane for having disobeyed. But do not forget that my Son’s mercy does not end, that it awaits the instant in which the human being repents. Time limits do not exist for the Divine Mercy; everything depends on the will of human beings. With sorrow I see how there are some who even in the last instants will blaspheme, and will form part of satan’s loot. Pray, my beloved, pray for the conversion of your brothers and sisters. The Church will suffer. God’s people will suffer, but will be elevated after their purification. The Church will meet its beloved husband And will be adorned with jewels and victorious; it will rise up glorious. I love you, my children. Remain in divine peace. Hail Mary most pure, hail Mary most pure, hail Mary most pure! I bless you in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Remain within my heart. Mother Mary.

2010,7,20,Holy Mary,July,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I love you, my children, I love you. The earth that has housed man weeps before humanity’s destiny. I am Mother of all of mankind, I suffer for those who have Not heeded heaven’s calls. The denial to conversion and rampant sin, have made the Divine Arm fall and it will not stop. What man has untied will not stop. Today there are those who deny my calls, fearful of an imminent truth that is hidden to merely human senses, by man’s will. The fulfilment of the prophecies worsens the global crisis by that very fact. In the midst of sin, man causes all that has been created by God’s hand to tremble. Evil has unleashed its fury against all of mankind. It has already announced its arrival. It walks capturing weak minds, without faith, so that seduced by traitorous instincts, they surpass the impiety lived in times past. Yes, my children, spiritual weakness has sapped hearts and these have risen up against mankind and will cause terror through all the earth. Pray, pray for the United States, California, Washington, New York. Pray for Honolulu. Pray for Russia, China, Japan and Venezuela. Pray for Brazil. Pray for Pakistan. Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. Pray for India. Pray for Israel. Pray for Ecuador. Pray for Mexico. Children, I invite you to prayer; maintain yourselves like lamps that do not go out. In prayer, do not forget in your intentions, those countries for which my Son and I have solicited prayer for, not only today, but in previous calls. I suffer for my children. Fire will rise from the earth and make it tremble. The periods of rain will increase. Each day will seem like a minute. Black gold will be a motive for more contamination. Nature will be inclement. Children, I warn you out of love. You must defeat evil and increase prayer. Turn to the sacrament of reconciliation; nourish yourselves from my Son’s body and blood. Do not forget to pray the creed in moments of temptation. The man that furrows the good path will see abundant fruits and will not stagger in his walking. My love and protection are permanent for all of my children. Evil will be conquered and you will rejoice in my Son’s presence. My Immaculate Heart is open for everyone. I love you. Mother Mary.

May the flame of faith not go out, may the flame of faith illuminate all of creation. In these instants in which the darkness approaches in leaps and bounds upon humanity, faith must grow in my people. Let nothing stop you, continue being conscious of my protective hand that opens the way for you. Darkness is coming. Darkness that man does not know at this moment, the true darkness that rushes towards mankind; the darkness that is not only physical but also spiritual. It is time for man to pay attention to my calls and those of my Mother. In those days of darkness, those who mock my word and my Mother’s love, will experience a double grief, they will experience a thirst that will not be quenched, they will experience spiritual thirst. I am love and I am justice. I will send my angels for my people; I will take them to a place of peace. I am justice and those who remain faithful to my word, will receive their just reward. Humanity lives extremely sad instants. You will wake up in a second before a great calamity that will cause men of every people and nation horror. But I walk before my children, crying out time and time again for conversion. My Mother suffers pain before the scourges that loom in an instant over all of mankind. I have called you insistently to turn to my Mercy. The present man offends me to a supreme degree, rebelling against his own nature. This is the reason for which creation itself does not recognize him. Pray, pray for the whole world. Very soon suffering will come to nation after nation consecutively. Evil has announced its arrival, but I am with my people, you are the apple of my eye! My people will rise gloriously, but first they must be purified. My Church must be purified in order to present itself before me. My protection and my infinite love remain and will remain with my people. Pray for those who mock and attack my calls and those of my Mother, they will be unfortunate, their lamentations will be heard everywhere. My Mercy is infinite and the one who turns to me truly repentant, will be forgiven. There are so many of my children who remain blind and will remain blind since the plague that the devil has launched against those who are mine, is a plague that hardens senses and hardens the heart so that you do not listen to me, and on the contrary it subtly leads you to commit terrible sins. Children, here I am. Come to me, repent for the sins you have committed, for I welcome you with infinite love.

My most precious blood is a fountain that satiates thirst. Turn to me, I wait for you without tiring. Do not ignore my calls. Worldly paths lead to error. You deny the existence of my House, you deny sin, you deny my Mother. What is this mankind waiting for, when pain is revealed before it, as a result of human freedom submerged in sin? You deny the existence of the enemy of the soul, satan. You spread falsehoods in order to trap those who are lukewarm. I suffer for those who console themselves saying, ‘all is good’, and that way they deny living under the dominion of sin. In the meantime, sin expands like the rays of the sun, while the spirit of impurity inundates public places, streets, homes, and even my temples. The innocence of the children is stolen without mercy, life is interrupted without remorse. Oh mankind, how you submerge yourself in darkness! The light is going out. Darkness will enter, the same one with which you live. Great cities will be shaken, abomination brings plagues towards man. Humanity will awaken with a great grief upon itself. Man’s very hand brings pain. Prayer must not wait. Pray for the throne of peter, for Asia, Thailand and Indonesia. Pray for Spain, Italy, Paris, England. Pray for central America. Beloved children, I call everyone to repentance and conversion. I call my faithful disciples, those who have consecrated themselves to my heart and my Mother’s Immaculate Heart, I call my people who walk silently, waiting for me. I call my congregation to wake up, to awaken their conscience, to not lose faith, to trust in my protection. Children, all that happens is not by chance; it is fruit of the sin that marks the fulfilment of the prophecies in this generation. Meditate upon daily behaviour, repent, amend yourselves and give fruits of eternal life. Be peacemakers, fulfillers of my will, see beyond what the human eye can see; do not hold fast to what is earthly, find me in all of creation. See the infiniteness of my love, you are my children!

2010,7,30,Holy Mary,July,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I am Mother of mankind. I peregrinate from heart to heart, calling time and time again. I do not want more souls to be lost, I intercede for each one. My calls are not heeded. My Son does not punish his own. I do not frighten you; I warn you out of love. I shape you in the linen of reality, the truth of this moment, in which all the prophecies converge, before the lack of values, before so much blasphemy and abomination. Sin has crossed the limits. It is a tower that continues to grow in size. Mankind has united to rebel against its creator. The smoke of sin has entered man’s heart, it has clouded the people of God and darkens the Church. The earth is now arid, the ocean is contaminated, man begs an incorrect love, ignoring God. Man has become being unrecognized by the cosmos that trembles before human hardness, which does not heed heaven’s calls. Beloved, a light that none of you have seen will come from on high, and each human being will see themselves, will see their own sin within a darkness that will seem interminable. The warning is coming for this generation. It is an act of merciful love from the most holy Trinity. Children, this is the precise instant for humanity to halt, and by not doing it for itself, the Trinitarian Love will descend to give man the opportunity to make amends. Some of my children deny heaven’s calls, you deny the warning, the punishment, the miracle, you deny the darkness that will envelope mankind. These children, spiritually blind, are loved by this Mother, pilgrim of love. They have confused mercy with licentiousness. Mankind’s disobedience, at all times has led it to purify itself, and this generation has elevated sin to its maximum expression. With sorrow, but with love, it must purify itself at this moment. Children, pray for France, fire will cause it pain. Pray for Puerto Rico. Spain will suffer. Pray for Venezuela, pray for Mexico. Pray for the Church. It is necessary, it is necessary. Little ones, my hand remains before each one of you. I peregrinate without stopping, my heart is the arc of salvation. Turn to the sacrament of reconciliation, duly prepared spiritually, And decently dressed. Do not ignore my calls, the nearness of all that I share with you is more than you can imagine.

Now, more than at any other instant, you must allow yourselves to unite human will with my will, so that the path is one, the feeling is one, the thinking is one, the action is one, the heart is one, the will is one. Man cannot continue to live apart from me, he must react and return with his shepherd, so that what is worldly does not continue to bring him closer to destruction. All that has been created, has been for each one of you. And with human consent, all that has been created, has been destroyed. Gratitude is lacking on man’s part, with his Lord. This behaviour has led mankind to this present moment, in which my love will bring you closer so that more souls are not lost. You omit my calls and those of my Mother. Conversion will come to human kind, Through my hand of justice and mercy. You are not honest with yourselves and mask the signs of the times; you do not see all that happens in the whole world. Mankind is insensitive to the pain of its brothers and sisters. You do not see the change in nature, you do not see the vertiginousness of the day, you do not see how much time has accelerated. My creation cries out for its place, and displaces man who has mistreated it. The animals perceive what is coming, they have changed their habits, they do not ignore what all of creation announces aloud. Man gifted with intelligence, at this moment still does not perceive what the cosmos cries out to him. Very soon, time will shorten in the face of another grinding of the earth. Where today you have ice, you will see fire. This acceleration of time brings in man a hurried walking towards sin, in that attachment to what is transitory. My heart sighs for those who are mine. My Mercy cries out to my people. With a clear sign in the sky, I will give my children the opportunity to make amends, before darkness enters their being and their conscience causes man to bend. You are my sheep and this shepherd comes to reunite his flock. Do not resist my love. My Church will be triumphant. Do not fear, evil will not prevail. I love you. You are my people. Come to me.

Humankind wanders in search of what it has lost, ‘the union with the most holy Trinity.’ Man must not distance himself from his creator, since the enemy of the soul will lead man to live submerged in sin. Good comes from God, evil is cause of man’s disobedience. Little ones, do not wait until the last instant of life in order to repent from the sins you have committed. Remember that the Divine Mercy is infinite, but do not abuse of it. God is love and justice. The cosmos palpitates in profound and respectful silence, awaiting the fulfilment of all that heaven has announced to a decadent humanity that ignores, forgets and despises my Son. Nature speaks to man but he does not listen and because of his free will, he walks without being aware of the seriousness of the events. The moon will cease to shine. The sun rushes towards the earth. The firmament will give signs of a great cosmic event. The water washes the earth, calling man to conversion. The land of the great eagle will move.

And it is precisely to you, who remain attentive to my calls and those of my Son, whom I ask again to redouble prayer for your brothers and sisters. There are those who deny time and time again the word come down from heaven in these times. These children of mine have been deceived by the malignant one through men who do not love the Church or my Son, but on the contrary; they rush against all that is of God, and will cause the Church great pain. They have not perceived that my Son’s church is being persecuted in the sight of all. In these moments, the earth sustains upon itself many unbelievers and followers of evil. These launch a hard offensive against the people of God year after year. They have succeeded in hardening the human heart, they have stopped thought and paralyzed the human conscience. Like in the past, the blessings from heaven continue for you and will continue; divine love knows no boundaries. It is man himself who refuses to receive the blessings, rejecting all that comes from the most holy Trinity. Man’s mouth does not open to give praise but to blaspheme, to hurt his neighbour, to gossip, to sin. The decadence is greater, instant to instant. Today the demons are pleased by the fruit of their labour in man. Life is despised, the very serious sin of abortion falls upon the earth, and the earth cries for each life that is cut by human beings, voluntarily. This very serious sin united with the innumerable sins of the flesh, shakes creation. All that has been created by the hand of God, Moves consecutively upon receiving all the human sin. The instant for expiation has arrived. The cosmos will provide from its own in order to move man to cry out for the pardon required. In its desire for man to be reunited with his creator, the cosmos will make its force come down, for the conversion of human kind. Darkness will be darker, silence will be more silent, fire will burn more and water will not put it out. It will be the time interval that the creator of heaven and earth will give nature so that it cleans, purifies, renews itself. My children will suffer the consequence of their constant denial. The angels in heaven remain in wait to take the people of God to a place of repose while the great tribulation scourges mankind. Children, the animals have changed their habits; they seek security before what is coming. A plague will scourge a great city; the animals will invade whoever has stolen their habitat. The water will continue its course through all the earth, a sleeping giant will awaken. Fire will rise to the surface again. Pray for Brazil, it will suffer again. Pray for Chile, it will be shaken. Pray for Thailand, it will weep. Pray for central America, it will suffer. Beloved children of my heart, Prayer does not remain without bearing abundant fruits, prayer fertilizes that which is most sterile, it softens hearts, it unites men. You my children, you who believe, pray for those who do not believe. Times will come in which everyone, united as brothers and sisters, will sing in a single voice the greatness of God. I keep you in my heart. My hand remains upon each one of you. Do not fear, good brings good. The faithful one will never be moved away from his Father’s side. Do not lose faith. My Son remains with his own forever. Remain in peace. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

Like a fortified city, my children impede me from penetrating their feelings, they hide within themselves sin, hatred, falseness, they ignore my words. They love that which is earthly, temporary, that which hardens them and leads them towards sin, they enjoy the easy path. You are my children. I educate those whom I love, with love and justice. The earth spins quickly without you perceiving it, causing the cloud of sin to discharge upon the earth by means of water, causing great suffering time and time again. Water pours over the earth. Tomorrow, it will be absorbed by the sun that will severely warm the earth, until it makes you feel like you are burning. The ally of man which today illuminates you, will become inclement. You will seek to distance yourselves from it and it will not be easy, everything will burn. Fire will fall from heaven and a comet will appear suddenly before the astonishment of all. Man will not find a hiding place, he will turn out the animals from their burrows, seeking a refuge. My creation has been mutilated by humanity. It fights to survive in the midst of its agony. Those who are mine will fight fiercely, first for black gold, then for sources of water. Pray for south Africa, it will suffer. Pray for Poland, it will lament. Pray for Japan, it will weep. Beloved children, you will see the fulfilment of all that I have announced to you. Man cannot predict the seasons exactly; the weather will never be the same. Fire will come out of the earth causing great astonishment. Children, you have marked time in order to measure day and night, you have given names to the days of the week, to the months. In my will, a day is a blink of an eye. Do not sleep. Remain awake. What used to be far from mankind will come about in an instant. Spiritual and physical preparation must take place urgently. Children, my love burns for each one of you, come to me. Listen to the voice of this shepherd who does not abandon his flock, soften your Hearts. Convert, turn to the sacrament of reconciliation, I wait for you with infinite love. My people will triumph, they will sit at my table, They will enjoy my nourishment for all of eternity. I bless you, have my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,8,29,Jesus Christ,August,"My beloved, My precious blood covers you. The unity of my people will help you to overcome the obstacles That appear on your path. My spirit guides my faithful. Evil spreads itself everywhere, the malignant one increases his followers, chaining man’s mind first in order to impede him from reasoning and thus giving himself over to all kinds of vices time and time again, leading man to live with sin. All that has been created, speaks to its creator. Man on the other hand, exalts himself with sin, giving death to love. My Cross is victory and it will shine in the firmament during seven days and nights. It will shine constantly. It will be a previous sign to all that my people await, and for those who do not believe, it will be a great confusion. Science will try to give an explanation to that which does not have a scientific explanation. Heaven weeps my children’s offenses; harmless brooks will become plentiful rivers in an instant, changing the geography. Nature will demonstrate its strength before a man weakened by the vice of the flesh and uncontrolled appetites. Columns of smoke will rise because of some nations that fight for supremacy in the world. Then humanity will see its disaster approach. Oh children, you will succumb by your own hand! The longings for domination have spread suffering in all ages. This generation will drink from its own cup. All technological advancements that exist, will be used by man against man himself. Innocents are annihilated constantly, without mercy. Today’s Herods walk alongside with my own, without you perceiving it. Instant to instant, thousands of innocents are cruelly aborted, thousands of innocents are marked by abuse; in the very home’s technology steals the innocence of children. What must be the reason? Herods see to it that innocence is thrown from the earth, so that evil takes power and control over humanity, and thus give growth to another generation mentally allied to the technological splendours with which the antichrist, enemy of my people, will rise up primarily through the youth. The din of the multitude shouted, crucify him! The clamour of a youth, from which they have extracted love little by little, and have injected ‘licentiousness’ into, will host the Antichrist’s banner and will cheer the antipope. Chaos will be generalized; confusion will reign throughout the globe. And I, king of kings, lord of lords, will put my own out to pasture. I will not abandon you; I will hear your cries; I will sustain you. My Mother’s lap will be a refuge for all. My Mercy will accompany you at every instant, my light will conquer the darkness and will open a path for all those who turn to me. Pray for Thailand. Pray for my vicar. Pray for the leaders of nations. Pray for New York. Pray for the Land of Fire (Tierra del Fuego). Pray for one another; cover yourselves with my precious blood. You are my people, the flock that I guide. I bless you. Have my peace. Your Jesus. Do not ignore my calls, my love alerts you. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,9,1,Holy Mary,September,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, The divine light illuminates my children’s path. Like a pilgrim of love, I go from heart to heart, from thought to thought, from feeling to feeling, opening the door of my heart, like an arc of salvation, to each human being. I call each one of my children to consecrate themselves to my Immaculate Heart, I call each one of my children to pray for the conversion of all the heretics and sinners, for the consecration of all of mankind to my heart. The minds undermined by evil, have publicly rushed against the faith of the holy, catholic and apostolic church. One by one the leaders of nations, will show their true face. Communism has risen up quickly upon the hunger, pain and ignorance of the nations. The dragon has increased its treasury by means of some leaders. The sleeping beast woke up without being perceived. My children, I love you. Do not fall asleep; remain on the right path united to my Son, nourishing yourselves from his body and blood, living in his will, being love and unity. Little ones, you will see with astonishment what you have ignored. Man has been replaced by technology, and with this, extreme hunger will cover all countries. Nature expires being replaced by the artificial. Evil knows about its defeat, it knows it will be crushed, and it anticipates is fight, its malice, against my children. Satan has launched his offensive and will attack those who are mine with all of his malice. Little ones, you live a slight shadow of what will happen unexpectedly. Satan has attacked the support of my Son’s people - the family. And from there he has started filling the thought of childhood with filth, corrupting the youth, blackening the example of adults. He has attacked those who are consecrated, priests, religious, so that they flaunt what is not my Son’s will and, in that way, distort, mix up, metalized what is sacred. That created by the hand of God, expires. Humanity maintains itself in moments of crisis, hunger is more visible, the powerful oppress the weak. The cosmos is life, man deprives life of life. The earth crumbles. Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, keep faith in the divine word, do not continue in what is superfluous. My mantle of Motherly love leads you through safe paths, it gives you to drink, it nourishes you, it strengthens you and illuminates you so that the darkness does not overpower you. Pray for Czechia and Slovakia, it will suffer. Pray for Spain, it will weep. Do not cease prayer for Mexico and the United States. Pray for central America, it will be scourged. Pray for Italy, it will be a victim of evil. Beloved children, each one of you is a pearl of infinite value; I call you to pray so that you may be fortified and you remain united to the Paternal House. Man cries out and God listens. No true prayer remains without bearing fruit; prayer must be a necessity for each one of you. This present in which mankind moves, is God’s instant. Do not fear, the Church will triumph. Joy will come to man; he will enjoy the divine love. Do not fear, do not fear, do not fear, The omnipotent hand of the father sustains you. I am the pilgrim Mother of love. I protect you; you palpitate in my heart. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,9,9,Jesus Christ,September,"Beloved of my heart, Children, you remain beating in my heart. I invite you to not let yourselves be conquered by suffering, but on the contrary, each stop must give you strength to fight without losing heart. Human difficulties must be nourishment for the soul. You should not let the suffering of your brothers and sisters pass by indifferently. You well know that prayer is indispensable so that you remain nourished. The sun star will charge this humanity for the mutilations to which creation has been submitted. This generation will not be complimented with false hopes, if it does not change its sinful living. Stinginess has taken root in the human heart to camp there, diverting man’s mind. Human will have given way to the surfacing of evil passions and all kinds of injustices. Mankind has given rise to confusion, men and women do not dress as such, do not behave with dignity. Beloved, there is a continual spiritual battle, the devil, enemy of souls, has found fertile ground in mankind’s evil behaviour and attacks with fury in order to steal those who are mine and take possession of my Church. They want to undermine the faith of my children, and these, push me away and ignore my calls and those of my Mother. My people’s bad response will bring more disasters upon all the earth. This is not a threat, it is the result that man himself has created, it is my Mercy that comes to you with total love, warning you about what is approaching, so that you correct your behaviour, since you live short instants, very short. I have shortened man’s time, in order to save souls, Before the punishment comes. Beloved children, The storm will scourge my children once again. The earth is collapsing without humanity being aware of it. Man drinks the chalice of his own sin. This is the reason for which you must hurry to prepare yourselves in all aspects. I call all to keep a single candle, the one of prayer. Prayer for my Church is necessary, the crisis enters with urgency. The earth will tremble in point after point. Pray for Mexico, Thailand, Europe, central America. Pray, pray for one another. My beloved, Have trust, maintain the faith. Fire will rise from volcanoes. Do not lose faith, hold on to my Mother’s hand. She, the new Eve, will bring peace, salvation, love to all who are mine. I love you; I do not abandon you. My people walk by my hand. Your Jesus.

2010,9,10,Holy Mary,September,"Dearly beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, Receive my maternal love. Return quickly to my Son and zealously guard the union with the Paternal House. Invoke my Son’s most precious blood, seal yourselves in it, it will rescue you from the clutches of the malignant one. Battle with yourselves; be in union with the Divine Will so that the path becomes less difficult. The air circulates everywhere, contaminated by humanity’s impurity. In its wake it will discharge all that it carries with it, returning to man the sin with which he has contaminated it. The rivers will not be harmless. No matter how small they may be, they will undermine the earth and will run with strength through the cities, devastating towns. All the elements combine in their effort to cleanse so much sin that grows upon the face of the earth. Sin is an enemy of the soul. Guardian angels weep in the face of the human being’s vertiginous fall, and cry out ‘purification’ to the most holy Trinity. My children do not see sin as such, they are not conscious of the sap with which this leafy tree nourishes itself, ‘satan’s poison, with everything that is contrary to God.’ Evils grow in the human being, they grow with the speed of a plague, to which nature itself responds with indignation, unloading its rage against mankind. Nature’s anger falls upon the earth with force. Man will see the sky light up, receiving constant attacks that will descend continually. Storms will be continuous; they will punish time and time again without mercy. Children, do not resist; creation calls you insistently to reflect. The imminent nearness of the scourges that will whip all of humanity, are the fulfilment of my calls, of my lamentations, of my warnings, of my tears, of my blood. As Mother I do not rest before the refusal of those who are mine to conversion. Satan harvests the fruit of sin. He has hardened the human heart. Man does not love himself, nor his fellow man. Crimes will increase vertiginously; life will be looked upon with scorn and revenge will give way to a merciless battle. Churches will be invaded by nonbelievers, sacrilege will take place time and time again; my children will be fearful, the devil has unleashed a cruel battle against life, against my children. It is the moment in which faith will be tested. The continual night will arrive in which lamentations will invade the face of the earth. Humanity will weep its sins; light will be longed for; the time of darkness will seem unending. The suffering of those who are mine will be elevated up to the throne of the most holy Trinity. Nourish yourselves from my Son’s body and blood, turn to the Eucharist daily. Little ones, you remain in my Immaculate Heart; I protect you, do not lose heart, you do not walk alone. Everything is conquered with love and fidelity to my Son. Do not fear little ones, do not fear, my angels guard you. My mantle covers you so that faith is not weakened. Continue in prayer. My Immaculate Heart will triumph. Pray for south America. Pray for the United States. Pray for Pakistan. Do not become discouraged, pray. I bless you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,9,11,Holy Mary,September,"Beloved children, All of you are gestated in my maternal womb. My Immaculate Heart vibrates with love for each one of you. My word maintains the essence of love with which I gestated my Son Jesus Christ, all are gestated in my maternal womb. Free will leads some to leave and continue their development outside of me, contaminating themselves with perversity, with atheism, with evil, with the ignorance with which the devil fills the human being, so that they give themselves over to sin with ease. My womb remains open; as Mother of humanity, I wait for those who have distanced themselves through wrong paths; I wait for them to welcome them and guide them towards my Son. The fulfilment of the commandments, of the sacraments, of the beatitudes, are in this moment, despised, and forgotten. Adults have forgotten true wisdom and pass on a life of sin to young people and children. Sin, human stubbornness will be carried upon the shoulders of all of mankind. There will not be anyone who does not live the great tribulation that is already within the face of the earth, manifesting its presence through nature, in order to weaken men’s pride and arrogance. There will not be anyone who does not feel the scourge that the sun, the moon, the universe, the water, the earth itself, the air, the animals and the plagues, will let fall upon every nation. Man, himself will turn against himself, trampling himself; the powerful nations will crush the weak ones with destructive weapons, product of an intelligence engendered in evil. Once again war will be a terrible scourge, in seconds it will cause entire nations to disappear; man will be mutilated for this reason, the contamination will lead men to suffer extreme hunger. The presence of the antichrist is bearing fruits, supplying the small ones in order to captivate them through armaments. A pain looms over my beloved peter, a grave pain. Fidelity is a utopia; values do not exist for the great majority. I lean on the faithful people, on those who remain alert, without sleeping, so as not to fall into temptation. Little ones, when you see the moon tinged with blood, praise my Son. The public appearance of the false prophet is in the blink of an eye. My beloved Israel is at the doors of a great warlike conflict. I convoke you to pray for Israel, Gog and Magog are prepared for war. Little ones prepare yourselves; mankind will enter into a collapse of all sort. The attacks worsen in great measure. Prayer is indispensable. Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, Do not fear, pray, keep the faith, daily communion is nourishment that fortifies, strengthens, fills with security. You do not remain alone, my Son loves you, he keeps you in the palm of his hand, so that nothing touches you. I bless you; I alert you out of love. Have peace. Mother Mary.

2010,9,13,Holy Mary,September,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, United to the Divine Mercy, walk with confidence. Beloved children, do not cause my Son pain, submerging yourselves in the marshy waters of that which is the worldly and temporary. My Son’s heart, afflicted by the sins of those who are his, Must be consoled by each one of you. His people have removed him little by little from their heart. Men have given fruit for the world and the flesh; temporary fruits, which have transformed them into sterile beings for God. Today the fear of God has been lost, man goes toward the temptation of the evil one, in order to sin; the devil does not have to tempt man much. Human pride has leaded you to laugh at the signs that heaven sends you, you do not take them seriously. There are those who in their pride believe that they can stop the divine designs. They see the signs and do not recognize them; they are submerged in sin. Extraordinary phenomena will be seen in the sky, to which scientists will give explanations contrary to the prophetic character of the phenomena. All the earth suffers natural attacks, suffers the evil that engenders man’s perversion. Oh humanity! Three days will come, which will submerge you in darkness, so much that many will feel it is the end of the world. Darkness like that of long ago in Egypt, darkness of the soul, physical darkness. Everything will tremble. You will feel as if it is the end of the world; you will be ashamed for having offended God so extremely. Whoever survives those days of suffering and fear will believe he is the only one left on earth. England will tremble before these days. Spain will suffer having precipitated itself to the abyss of sin. The Tiber will overflow and will leave the city covered with fish. Do not despise the Divine Mercy, do not despise my calls, Today you live tribulation everywhere, do not continue like blind ones. Each event hides a great mystery, which carries you vertiginously closer to the flood of fire. It will be painful; there are very green logs that are difficult to burn. Flood of fire, announced like the universal flood was announced, mocked as in the past. Sky and earth will unite. Children, Pray, seal yourselves with my Son’s most precious blood, cover yourselves with my mantle and welcome this pilgrim of love that goes from heart to heart with her word seeking a place to nest. Saint Michael the archangel protects you, drives away evil if you ask it of him with faith and humility. Turn to the sacrament of reconciliation. Nourish yourselves with the Eucharist. Make reparation for those who do not believe, for those who blaspheme. I love you; I announce to you, I call you to reflect, I intercede so that all see the Divine Face. I intercede so that the sadness of those who suffer be converted to joy. My Son will purify everything and renew it. The Church will flourish with splendour. My children will shine in the divine light. Everything will pass, peace will be experienced in fullness, the fusion with my Son will give you the taste of the divine riches. I bless you. I love you; you are not alone. This your Mother accompanies you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,9,15,Jesus Christ,September,"Beloved children, I keep you in the palm of my hand, like birds inside their nest. I invite you to unity among all my people, And to unite in a single voice elevated to my House in prayer. Children, a heart open to my love is necessary, so that I can guide you. I come with my love to calm the thirst that only I can satisfy. The thirst of the soul that seeks without knowing what it lacks in order to maintain peace. The love for those who are mine compels me, compels me to convoke you so that in unity, you are a testimony of living in my will, in this moment in which some wish to drown the words in the throats of my faithful instruments. My people, my beloved people! Open the eyes of the soul so that the fog that the evil one causes does not cloud your vision. The enemy of the soul, satan, works without rest in order to maintain humanity captive and in that way proliferate confusion, discord, the denial of my word in the sacred scripture, deny my Mother’s immaculate conception and send men to the abyss of fire. The bread of faith is lacking for my children. You succumb before evil due to ignorance, because blinded, you despise all that reminds you of a correct life, you have accepted evil as your guide. Those who are mine succumb due to the lack of shepherds that fight evil with my word. Man’s pride wishes to reach my House and like Babel, will fall. The punishment that humanity itself has forged, will come; the excess of the ruling sin will be brought down. Beloved, the powers of this age will vomit fire upon mankind, the spectre of war rises quickly. Plague has already taken its step, scarcity will lead my people to give themselves again into the hands of its enemy, who will emerge with all his power, with pain in his mouth, and will lead you to rise against me. I am compassionate and merciful; I will await the return of my people. Tribulation will bring you to my lap, not because I am a punisher. My love has given freedom of action to all my children, and you have chosen the painful path. Creation praises me, man exiles me. Creation cries out against man for his indifference with my House. Creation has rebelled against man. Pray for Mexico. Pray for the United States, pain will come. Pray for Australia, the tears will flow. Children keep the faith. My Church will prevail, evil will not succeed, keep the faith. My Mother will be my people’s protector at all times, queen and intercessor of humanity, comfort of the afflicted. She is Mother and teacher. Do not ignore the calls of my House, otherwise the heat of sin may become physical. Come to me, repentant sinners, my love is infinite. I bless you. Your Jesus.

I show you the path so that you find yourself with my Son Jesus Christ. I want to cover the spiritual nakedness that prevails in the midst of mankind so that you are not lost. My most holy Son died on the Cross for each one of you, for each one of you who remains is the Tabernacle, for each one of you he makes himself present in the Eucharist. I am Mother and suffer for what happens to you. The purification is in an instant, closer than mankind thinks. You are amazed by heaven’s announcements, but you contradict them. Should it not be a motive of admiration that in the midst of so many vices, God has not yet intervened? Do not forget that you are exhorted to conversion, not threatened, but exhorted. You have forgotten Nineveh! You are warned about what is coming in order to enliven faith, And so that all children of God have the certainty that they are not abandoned, forgotten. On the contrary, you are warned so that you pray and prepare. Do you not recognize creation’s echo that warns you aloud? This is the instant in which thunder will move the earth. The human heart does not palpitate at its rhythm, but at the rhythm that nature marks for it. The water advances from land to land. Earthquakes will leave countries beneath ruins, nature has united with a same feeling, in order to awaken man image and likeness of God. You move in the midst of the great crisis that increases more and more, until reaching global collapse. Extreme hunger will take possession of my poor children. Open your heart to this call. The demons have been unleashed in order to tempt my children. You must not measure time with human measurement; time vibrates in a profound instant, in the divine sigh. This time has been greatly shortened and will be even more. The earth is no longer the same, it will change more soon. Beloved children, All the prophecies will be fulfilled in this generation. Their consummation will lead to the height of the eternal kingdom of peace and justice. You are warned so that you heed my grievous calls, in the face of the great purification of fire through which you will pass. I prepare you like valiant warriors so that you battle against the evil one, with the sureness of victory. As captain of the celestial army, I will keep you in my heart, from which will flow the remedies and elements so that you come out unharmed from this great test. Saint Michael the archangel will defend you with his sword, he will go before you, before my children. A new heaven and a new earth, fused, totally reconciled, Will be the fruit of faith. Beloved children of my heart, I remove the veil from your eyes so that you see what others refuse to see. Pray, pray, prayer strengthens you, it does not permit the spirit to become sick. Pray So that the light does not abandon you. In this moment prayer is necessary. Prayer oxygenates the being. The Holy Rosary steers you to the refuge of my heart. The evil one cannot stand my presence, with each hail Mary the malignant one retreats. Turn to receiving my Son in the Eucharist, nourish yourselves daily. Pray for Romania. Pray for the middle east. Pray for Lisbon. Pray for Ecuador. Pray for Peru. Heed my calls. I love you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

Each prayer born from a faithful heart, is a treasure that increases the Trinitarian joys in heaven. Children, I invite you to not let yourselves be defeated by the treacherous voices that drown in the human heart, in order to stop you like a dagger. Do not halt at your wounds, on the contrary, continue step by step, giving it all for the divine triumph. People forge heaven for themselves with their actions that are more angelic than human. The eagles sail the skies, my Son’s people are called to sail the skies. My beloved, this is the awaited instant. Humanity’s lamentation is open, it spills out. The lamentation falls upon the city of the seven hills, a black eagle will go to it and will spread pain for all of humanity. Satan’s evilness has risen up against the Church, infecting man’s mind. Satan’s satellites launch their waves in order to make man rise up against God. The devil’s emissaries prepared the way of the antichrist who moves through the earth, communicating its errors, irreligion, impiety, uncontrolled libertinism, under a false modernist philosophy. With sorrow I look upon the custodians of the faith, asleep. For this reason, I will remove my light from those that exile me in the face of a great indifference that does not find correction. France will suffer greatly, three times, woe! Poor France! It will ask for help and will lack it. My heart suffers for those who are mine. Fire will fall upon France without it knowing where the fire comes from. Germany will suffer, poor Germany! Poor Germany! Poor Germany! Italy will weep. Its lamentations will be heard from north to south, they will be as numerous as the fishes left by the Tiber. England will be shocked. This will be a sign of the announced events. The epidemics do not wait, just as heaven announced; these will be more devastating. War will touch town after town. The punishments will continue, water will continue its scourge; the angel of God will not put his sword in its sheath until after having punished all the nations. In this moment, man’s regeneration is imminent and necessary. Greece, pray intensely. Pray for yourself! Pray for grand Cayman. Beloved, remain alert. The false prophets rose in order to confuse with frequent miracles and revelations, before the eyes of all, in order to increase the ranks of their followers and lead them through wrong paths. But my beloved, You will not be tested beyond your strength. My Son protects you, guides you. Do not turn away from him. Live in unity so that evil does not touch you. The Church will triumph, it will rise glorious. Do not decay in faith, rise up, you are children of the king. I announce to you so that you do not fall, so that you pray and make reparation for sinners. Adore God One and Triune. I bless you. Remain in my heart. Mother Mary.

2010,9,25,Jesus Christ,September,"Beloved children, I am Love and Mercy. I am unity. I love you; I light the way so that you do not perish in the darkness of sin. Man, our image and likeness, has conformed to his convenience a duality, separating ‘nature and human being.’ Mankind has decided to love only itself, destroying all that, as a divine gift, exists in creation, seeking only human wellbeing. Man’s life must be a constant thanksgiving and, a perennial praise towards our Trinity. Humankind lives off of the exterior. They have forgotten to sanctify the senses and have given themselves over to sin, personified in the base instincts. Man’s blindness is so great that he does not see the signs of the times. Man’s blindness is so great that, seeing himself beaten by the elements, he denies his own suffering, denies what he cannot deny and with this prophetic reaction, submerges himself more and more in his own scourge. Humanity lives a perennial fight between my Church and those who reject me, between love and hate, between life and death, between grace and sin. Children, I call you to live from my love. You who know and recognize what is coming, Avoid all that harms the spirit and fortify yourselves in faith. You must grow in holiness; good works must duplicate so that you are strengthened in spirit. Beloved, prepare yourselves, the sun will pour out its wrath against man the earth will see itself covered in fire and the wind will no longer be man’s friend. The earth will turn upon itself, the sun will be hidden and darkness will arrive. They will be days of agony, in which faith will be tested. Pray for my Church, it is going to split without obeying my vicar. The clergy will separate, modernist reforms will divide one from another, unity will disappear and the lay people will be confused. Communism, the cancer of nations, advances maintaining its armaments hidden, preparing itself to exterminate and subjugate the nations through force. Children, I have called you to stop and look within yourselves. You do not obey, you refuse insistently. In the face of man’s refusal, I will stop you, everything will remain inert. Before me, all of creation will keep silent so that man looks within himself. The earth prepares itself to be purified again. The firmament will show the imminence of this moment. Humanity will be astounded in the face of what it has denied. Pray for the United States, it will suffer. Pray for Bolivia, it will suffer. Pray for Switzerland, pray. Scotland will weep. Man’s hatred will bring death, it will hide in the burrows in order to not be seen. Children, I feed you from my hand. My Mercy descends continually attracting the repentant. My people will germinate in fertile ground and will live beside me. My beloved, continue trusting in my protection. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,9,27,Jesus Christ,September,"Beloved children, Receive my blessing. I call you to conversion, to repentance. Do not be deaf to my voice. You continue to crown me with thorns. Separate yourselves from sin, return to the true path. Do not call love that which you take up with illusion and leave instantly. Youth, do not fear being despised, insulted; be the difference that marks a stop on the way. Look within yourselves, without evading the defects, attachments and sins, since the evil one looks attentively at your inclinations in order to increase human weaknesses, and that way, you turn against one another. Resist in the face of temptation, do not deny yourselves conversion. I am Love and Mercy, come to me, know me, I wish to forgive and save you. If you pay attention to my calls, I will give a grace so that the human heart softens. Just as the bee is attracted by the honey of the flowers, so I will attract the souls that repent. Turn to the sacrament of reconciliation. Nourish yourselves from my Body and my Blood. The sicker you are, the more you need of me. I do not tire of waiting for you, but do not abuse of my Justice. Those of obstinate heart must know that my truth shines. Even when I speak to you of my patience, do not think that abusing it you will attain forgiveness. Do not sin expecting to be forgiven, since whoever acts in that manner is a scorner, not a penitent. You live within the prophecies; the suffering has been brought on by mankind. Half of the cup has already spilled out upon humanity and with it the beginning of unknown plagues that are already moving silently. The enemy of the soul unfolds his great offensive against all of my people, natural disasters continue before a hollow earth that collapses. The ambitious and cruel minds will mark the Exact point for the beginning of the war, in an inflamed humankind, which has been prepared little by little through technology, to see war and slaughter as something normal and every day. Man has been trained 24 hours a day in the new concentration camps called, ‘homes or centres of recreation.’ This has been a plan plotted by the enemy and it will bear its fruit. From the cosmos fire approaches the earth. Pray for New York, it will suffer. Missouri will suffer. New Zealand will suffer. Brazil will weep. Bolivia, Peru, Chile will weep. Beloved children, I do not abandon you, my word does not run out, just as my love for mankind, for all of creation does not run out. Make reparation, do not cease to pray; open your lips to praise, to give thanks for all that you receive continuously. Ask, ‘your kingdom come’ Receive my Mother’s loving calls and take refuge in her womb. Do not forget my call. Engrave it in your heart. It is written in heaven. I bless you, remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,9,29,Holy Mary,September,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, As Queen of the Angels, I invite you to unite in this Act of adoration to the most holy Trinity. Who is like God? Is proclaimed in heaven and on earth. Pray to saint Michael the archangel, to saint Gabriel the archangel and to saint Raphael the archangel. Beg for the protection of these archangels and profess with faith, ‘I believe in God the father, the almighty, maker of heaven and earth, I believe in Jesus Christ his only son, our lord, who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit…’ My children, unite in prayer, entrust yourselves to the care and protection of the archangels and of all the angels. Entrust yourselves to your guardian angel. It is essential that you trust in the guidance and care of the messengers of God. Pray, ask and allow your protectors to help you in your journeying. My angels do not rest, they constantly go from earth to heaven and from heaven to earth. It is true that my angels keep helping you at every moment, but they are respectful of man’s will. Even so, they do not tire of remaining beside each one of you. Heaven’s vault opens to man’s purification. Heaven’s vault opens to man’s holiness. I intercede for each one of you, I wait for you with my heart open for all. Children, the elements have been seriously attacked by mankind, who receives the same violence it used. Mankind’s excesses have claimed lives with unknown diseases, which have spread with the wind and that my children must respond to with faith in the Divine Protection. Without faith you will not go far, without faith everything will seem to have no way out. The Eucharist is divine nourishment, not only to the spirit, but to the body. The use of sacramentals is not superstition, it is faith, hope, love, humility. Ah children! The heart must be emptied of that which is worldly and erroneous. Return to the good habits; your ancestors’ legacy must be taken seriously. The praying of the Holy Rosary is a wall that leads you to remain firm in the face of temptation, it leads to unity, it sensitizes you and it floods you with love. For each Rosary prayed with faith, I will bring comfort to the soul that needs to be consoled. For each Rosary prayed with devotion, my angelic legions will help whoever is in danger. For each Rosary prayed with devotion, I will help whoever prays it, driving away the devil. Whoever prays the Holy Rosary every day with devotion; I will assist them in moments of temptation and will cover them with my mantle in persecutions. My hand will guide them through safe paths. Prayer continues it does not remain without bearing fruits, I present it before the most holy Trinity. Beloved children, you will suffer; I suffer for each one of you. The earth will tremble, I call you to not forget that where a soul devout to the most holy Trinity dwells and prays the holy Trisagion, lessening of the scourges will be granted. Children, you will see a sign in the moon. The sea will rise like a giant. You will see the prophecies be fulfilled. Prayer for Mexico is necessary. United States will tremble. Pray for hanoi7, they will suffer. Humanity suffers, prayer unites. My heart remains open to lodge everyone. Little ones, I love you. I bless you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,10,3,Holy Mary,October,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I call you not to abandon prayer. Children, in the face of these pressing instants in which desolation approaches man causing damages never before seen... Instants in which nature emerges to make itself felt...instants in which humanity, weakened in its principles by maximized sin, lies without strength to confront evil...in these instants I invite you to lift your eyes to heaven and trust in the Divine Mercy. Beloved, persevere in faith. A racial battle is coming in which my children will suffer in the United States and other countries of Europe. To my children of the United States, I call you to conversion, to turn to the sacrament of reconciliation and to go to communion. I also invite you to pray the holy Trisagion and I call you to pray the creed. Confusion will come to England. France will live moments of pain. Pay attention to the signs of this moment and you will be conscious of the fulfilment of what I announce to you. The earth will tremble. Fire will rise towards the surface quickly. The enemy comes with false promises of peace. Beneath his false face hides the antichrist, who brings heartrending pain for the faithful church. They try to bring down my Son’s church. They will cause her to suffer great pains. They will not prevail against her. When they think they’ve brought her down, she will be lifted up and will reign glorious for ever and ever. Children, I call you to receive the body and blood of my divine Son in the Eucharist, duly prepared, so that you are not lost in the midst of the disconcertment. Be the antidote that minimizes evil, frequenting the sacraments and being faithful to my Son’s love. Do not surrender, fight for the salvation of your soul, fight for your brothers and sisters. I remain beside you, I help you, I prepare you and guide you in the fight. Little ones, the word of God is a refuge for all of mankind. Know it; cling to it and do not doubt the father’s help for those who are his. The Holy Spirit will overwhelm you with good things, giving you light, that light from which all good comes. Thus, humankind’s expiation concluded, man, creation of God, will be pride of his Father, living in his will. The king of heaven and earth will reign beside those who are his for all of eternity. His is the kingdom, the power and glory, forever and ever. Amen. I bless you. I love you. Remain in peace. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

2010,10,6,Holy Mary,October,"My beloved, day is no longer day; night is no longer night. This plan has been drawn up by evil so that my children cannot maintain themselves united in prayer with their Father’s House. The coming and going of the everyday has stolen time from my children, so that you distance yourselves from the fusion you must maintain with God. The cosmos remains magnetized to man at this moment, united to the necessity of man’s purification, and this will not cease until that human urgency is totally concluded. You, beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, are love, but more love is still needed; you are mercy, but more mercy is needed; you are patience, but more patience is needed; you are commitment, but more commitment is needed, you keep the faith, but you must reinforce it in this moment; you live with hope, but you must reinforce hope. As Mother and teacher, I urge you to live the gospel more fully. I urge you to give yourselves over to the Paternal House more and more. I urge you to vitalize your strength through prayer, Since the coming instant is chaotic. You must cast off the chains that you have willingly imposed upon human will and that at this moment hold you back and lead you to feel that your strength to fight spiritually and physically has abandoned you. It is not so, my beloved children; all that the human being imposes upon himself/herself willingly, is a hinderance that closes off his/ her path leading him/her to confusion and the feeling of loneliness. You must grow more, you must walk with faith instant to instant, Knowing that my Son does not abandon you; having total confidence that Prayer moves the spiritual motor. Whoever does not pray, becomes arid; whoever does not pray stops. Pray, prayer is unity, and only through unity will you be able to elevate that infinite petition of intercession for the needs of all of humanity, before the throne of the most holy Trinity. The day is almost not day, in the blink of an eye it has gone by. Night is no longer sufficiently long to give you the necessary rest. But I ask you that in the midst of this convulsive coming and going of life, you maintain yourselves united constantly in prayer; united in supplicant attitude, united in offering before the Trinitarian Throne. An astonishing event that I have repeatedly announced, will take place in the sky. An unexpected event will take place in Costa Rica. Maintain faith, hope and unity. I hope you continue with faith, continue encouraging you who believe, you who love, you who adore. Continue encouraging through intercession; be one another’s support. In a shaking of the terraqueous globe, man will shake to his conscience, to his entrails. The sadness that invades me, leads me to remind you that man inclines to seek his Father in moments of anguish, but once these pass, man returns to that which is worldly. Today I call you with maternal love to walk bending the libertinism of human egoism. That human egoism that leads you continuously to prefer the superficial and earthly in place of the supernatural and eternal. Today I call you to cast off that worldly behaviour and take my hand so that you let yourselves be guided by this Mother and teacher, and in that way willingly put yourselves in the right road and be able to consecrate the human ‘I’ to the most holy Trinity. That way you Will become impregnated with that infinite love that allows you to see my Son in your brothers and sisters, so that you do not act lightly. All is already said, but prayer is infinite and in it you will be able to keep faith very high. My Son does not abandon his people. Many of my children maintain themselves in a state of nervousness before the revelations. We do not alert with this purpose, but so that you prepare spiritually, totally confident in the Divine Mercy. I will never abandon my own. I will be with my Son at the head of the Church, forever. Beloved children, I bless you, remain in my Son’s peace. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,

The time of the harvest approaches, sin does not allow the fruit to ripen. I invite you to turn to my calls in this moment. The lord of the harvest will come without being expected or desired. My children, salvation remains before each one of you. It is urgent that the awareness of sin and of lost time leads you to true repentance. My children must prepare themselves quickly And thus, keep themselves alert so as not to fall. In the great work of creation, each one of you is special and unique. It is painful to see you so severely lost; it is painful for me to see you join in the ranks of uncontrolled excesses, in total freedom. The earth has aged with man; its surface is wounded, in a state of agony. It is time for the earth to renew itself, she shows her inside, she is about to be reborn. Due to this, humanity will continue its suffering. Tears will be shed soon in the great cities. The water will continue to call to repentance. Pray for California, there will be tears on the coast. The temperatures will descend as never before, in the same degree as man has descended in his spiritual life. I suffer for each one of my children. Pray, prayer is constant unity with the most holy Trinity. My children be true testimonies of divine love. The word is a gift of blessing, be ambassadors of that blessing for each one of your brothers and sisters. You are the chosen people. Do not ignore the call like in the past. The giant of communism has risen and will cause great pain. Nuclear armament will be used and with-it death and pain will be spread leaving a painful wake, never before seen. Children, it is necessary that my Son’s church unite and you nourish yourselves with his divine blood and his divine body. Prayer is necessary in order for you to fortify the spiritual body and fortify the union with the house of the Heavenly Father. Prayer is necessary so that with it you incense the Trinitarian Throne. Prayer of adoration, of reparation, of petition and of thanksgiving is necessary. Do not continue to ignore my calls any longer. You have a father who loves you. Beloved, I call you to accentuate the love and respect for those who have given you life. I treasure you deep in my Immaculate Heart. Do not reject my calls. Remain in my Son’s peace. Mother Mary.

2010,10,18,Holy Mary,October,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, My heart is a fountain of love for each one of you. One glance is enough for you to seize heaven! I call you to reflect, to turn to the sacrament of confession. I invite you to take part in the Eucharist duly prepared. Make reparation; make reparation for the scorn with which my Son is received because of the immodesty in dress upon receiving him in the Eucharist. Faith is being lost in great measure in the midst of a total spiritual, moral and social decontrol. Spirituality is offered like merchandise. Man has lost himself in false doctrines, those that offer salvation in exchange for adhesion. These false doctrines are home of the wicked one, who has begun his offensive against mankind. Man, himself will raise up the one who will be his greatest executioner. Do not hand over the body, temple of the Holy Spirit, to the spirit of evil. The powerful already control mankind, which who places its hope in the God of money. A great nation will drink from the cup of suffering. My heart suffers for the innocents. Pain will arrive disguised. Evil seeks guilty ones among the innocents. Yes, I suffer; I suffer for the pride of the powerful. They do not satisfy their desire for conquest. Creation shudders before so much evil. China will weep, the earth will shake, pray for my children. Pray for my children of Mexico. Pray for my beloved vicar. Water continues to wash the sin that falls upon the earth. The ocean will once again be contaminated. Beloved children, do not halt, continue to walk in silence and unity. Triumph awaits you; you will unite yourselves to my Son, with him you will enjoy eternal life. Do not halt. Do not forget the respect towards the gift of life. The plague walks without being discovered, do not decay in prayer. Do not ignore my calls, come to my heart, open the door to this pilgrim of love. I remain before each one of you, I do not abandon you. I love you. I bless you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.

I satiate your thirst with my Word, I maintain you within each one of me Wounds. My blood carries the name of each one of you imprinted upon it, You are my great treasure. Little ones, with subtlety evil has braided its nets without mankind thus perceiving it. This moment is a product of evil’s large project, the one that has been introduced into human Minds in order to maintain the world under its temporary dominion. My commandments are trampled time and time again. Love is taken with a very dangerous free will. The family was used by the powerful allies of evil. They have caused it to fall, it is No longer necessary in nations. It is not necessary politically or economically; evil does not Need of it. A profound silence descends upon the innocents. The shadows advance without stopping. Appearing to make advances, humanity becomes self-destructive. Creation maintains its order; man believes himself to have surpassed it. Creation fights to Survive, man does not react. Children, you cannot move the sun from its place, you cannot move the moon from its place. Man, my creation, has proposed to exile me from my creation. Children, you reduce the path, opaque the light, turn back, bring pain and great hunger. You Do not see that evil has usurped power in the nations to control them. Humanity will suffer What it has chosen willingly. The crazed youth is utilized. With pain I see its suffering without Measure. My Church will suffer to its foundations in order to be purified and Renewed. I convoke you to prayer, strength of my people, indissoluble union with my House. Beloved children, pray for your brothers and sisters of the United States, of Mexico and of Indonesia. Pain looms. Beloved children, pray for the youth, their blood will be shed without measure. Beloved children, pray for my priests, persecution will no longer disguise Itself. Beloved children, pray for my vicar, do not leave him without prayer. My Mother suffers for each one of you. Blessed are those who maintain themselves in my Mother’s womb. Children, do not fear. My redemptive blood lifts up my people triumphant. Creation reclaims its king, and I come for my people. Beloved children, in prayer you find my peace. In the sacrament of reconciliation, you receive my forgiveness. Nourish yourselves from my body and blood in the sacrament of the Eucharist. I love you.

Beloved children, seek the light of God, do not walk in the dark. I am beside each one of You. Embrace the Cross, when you see it in the sky you will know that the darkness is near. Do not fear because the light contained within the Cross will not cease. I will be a lamp in The heart of my children. Beloved children, my heart bleeds for each soul that strays, that succumbs before the Inexorable weight of spiritual mutilation, which passes by mercilessly tearing down those who go through life without God. The devil whips consciences, flooding them with a modernism based on the total degradation of the human being. The human mind, crazed, will establish its false law, ‘united humanity.’ The empire of terror has risen, the mask of ‘freedom for the nations’ broke through in this moment of struggle between the light and the darkness. Man has trespassed against the Divine laws. The sun will darken, darkness will reign. I call my beloved priests to retake the strength of the divine word. Beloved children, science will have its end and mankind will return to ancient times. Pray for Israel, death will arrive. Pray for Chile, it will suffer. Pray for central America. Pray for Brazil, its people will suffer. Beloved, in this moment in which creation moans in a single voice, seek God and do not Separate yourselves from his merciful love. I suffer for each one of my own. It is time to prepare yourselves. I offer you my heart, my womb is an arc of salvation. Pray the Rosary, and offer it for humanity. Do not grow weak, do not fall, do not turn away. I intercede for all, call me, I hasten to you. I take you away from the wiles of evil and guide you towards my Son. The times of blessing will come.

2010,11,1,Holy Mary,November,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, The joy of brotherhood is distinctive of God’s children. Fraternal love increases blessing, it strengthens the faithful. The Church is not founded upon moving sands, but upon firm rock. The forces of evil advance against God’s people. The Church fights against satan’s spawn in A bloody battle that surpasses the physical and is accentuated in the spiritual. Technological advancements will be the principal weapon of the malignant one in order to Possess the minds of men and control the lukewarm of heart and those who live away from The divine love. Children, the dragon has come out of its hiding place in order to show its power, it advances Without man perceiving its steps. The fire from its mouth will devour the earth, the poison That it distils will exterminate a great portion of humanity. With chains it will drag its Captives. Its voice will make the earth tremble. The usurper works to weaken the heart of the Church, and so split one against the other Within the Church until it is divided. He will plunder the temples and seek his loot among souls. He will delight in the flesh of innocents. The angels will descend and will Rescue the holy people. Little ones do not close yourselves off to what is coming. Prepare yourselves, pray, nourish Yourselves with my Son’s body and blood in the Eucharist. Beloved children, do not forget to pray for the souls of purgatory. My beloved, pain and death will come once again. The earth will tremble. Pray for Chile. Pray for Argentina, it will undergo moments of suffering. Pray for the United States. Pray for Indonesia.

Man, easily falls into weaknesses without perceiving it. In this moment and in those that follow, You have the obligation to pray and offer up for those who are troubled, Like the brothers and sisters that you are. Nature feels alone and abandoned before a humanity that has aborted, mutilated and Exiled it. Nature resembles a cocoon that holds within it the most beautiful fruit; man has Cut the fruit before. Nature cries its misfortune and shudders from pain. Beloved, you suffer the misfortune of imprudent behaviour. Humanity quickly approaches the long night. You have eyes but will not be able to see.

I invite you to store all the possible spiritual goods, through a continued practice in the Action and behaviour of every instant. I invite you to store and store love; forgotten, but love lives as I live. Store up for the times of tribulation, store up because the enemy comes against my Church.

Moments of suffering, moments of grief await humanity. I suffer for my beloved; I suffer For it. As king, I have given freedom to my own so that they choose the path to follow, but As king I give creation freedom so that it calls to my people, so that it makes my people Tremble and my own turn their gaze towards me.

My people, return quickly to your king, I invite you to share my table. For that you must act With righteousness and refuse the domination of the antichrist who today raises people Against people, quietly, without you noticing it. His snares fill the minds of world leaders so That nations look upon each other with contempt, so that nations rise against one another. I invite you to pray for the middle east. This prayer is very important in this moment. I invite you to pray for the country of peace, Costa Rica. I invite you to pray for Brazil. I invite you to pray for Mexico with promptitude. It will be shaken. I invite you to pray with promptitude for France. Suffering will pass through this land of Mine. My people, do not fear. Whoever remains in me, does not die.

2010,11,23,Holy Mary,November,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I invite you to walk, illuminated by the sun of the Divine Will, so that man sighs for the love of his creator. The Divine Mercy opens itself to its children, So that they do not feel abandoned and convert. Beloved children, I urge you to prayer. I urge you to pray the Holy Rosary throughout the Whole world and in this way, all unite in the greatest chain of prayer. Unity in the Same prayer is essential. In the Holy Rosary you pray the creed, reaffirming faith in one God, faith in the most Holy Trinity. You pray for the unity of the Church, the resurrection of the flesh, eternal life. You pray Our Father asking that the kingdom come to man that the Trinitarian Will Be done on earth, as it is in heaven. You ask for spiritual bread and material bread, you ask Not to fall into temptation. You pray the hail Mary asking my intercession and here I am To intercede for my faithful children. Little ones, the malignant one works his appearance and before this act, fights to lead man Towards hecatomb and fight among the nations. The malignant one fights against my Son’s Church; he fights against the children of the woman clothed with the sun. The devil will not be victorious. For that the faithful people must remain united in Prayer, in a true testimony of divine love, before which the devil cannot win. Before this man will be purified time and time again. Humanity will suffer. The elements Will turn against man. What served man before, will turn against him. The earth spills out Its force and it makes man who will suffer very soon, weep. Water will again scourge man the air will carry the plague with great quickness throughout The whole world, fire will rise in one country and then another, the earth will shake soon. Children, you will be scourged repeatedly. How I suffer for it! Those who are powerful will Bring suffering, in their eagerness to seize mankind. Little ones, fire will come forth. Pray for Iceland. Pray for San Francisco, water rises above the land that shakes. The air will be contaminated. Insistently I have invited you pray for Asia, do not fall. The spectre of war rises. Pray for the middle east. Pray for Costa Rica. Pray for Nicaragua. Mankind has blindfolded its eyes, with the aim to evade sin. Because of that the moon Blushes before mankind’s eyes. The sun will blush causing severe damages. The air will harm man it will contaminate food. Industry will contaminate a great country. Pray for the United States, suffering will pass through this land. I suffer for my children; I suffer for those who do not believe in my calls. I suffer for those souls that confuse those who are mine, misleading them. I suffer for those who rise against me. I suffer for those who do not love my Son and deny him repeatedly. The stars will darken for three days. Children of my heart, do not lose heart, my calls are urgent. I alert you insistently, supply yourselves with what is necessary before Night falls. I will not stop; I pilgrimage from heart to heart. Open the door to me. I call you to return to the true path. Leave aside perdition. Turn to the sacrament of reconciliation. Nourish yourselves from my divine son’s body And blood. Allow yourselves to soar through the skies without the bondage of the mundane, turn to The Divine Mercy, enjoy true freedom. Do not fear, God calls you, it is not him who punishes. Human obstinacy leads to the abyss. Beloved, I especially bless whoever looks upon this call of mine with faith. Solicit a special favour and remain in the state of grace. I love you, little ones. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,11,28,Jesus Christ,November,"Beloved children, My gaze remains upon my people. My word will keep reigning eternally. The attacks will not stop the triumph of my will upon every human being. Persevere, beloved children, persevere. Evil has thrown its dart of hate upon humanity, and humanity has ignored me, being easy Prey. The minds made huge by power ally themselves, causing pain to the nations, the Borders will close. My children continue to create false idols. They hand themselves over to them, dazed by The voices of pleasure and of false ideals that will lead them to kill their brothers and sisters. Evil spreads with the wind, poisoning the weak minds that do not know my love. Prey of The malignant one, they become inflamed against their brothers and sisters. Pray for Europe. Pray for Asia. Pray for the middle east. The water continues its course. Death will dress in white. Nature does not give truce. Darkness approaches quietly the sly. Do not fear, my light will illuminate my faithful, And they will be torches that evil will not be able to touch. In this waiting period that you have begun in advent, I call you to maintain an attitude of change. I invite you to set a goal that marks definitively the change in you, beloved Children. It is essential for everyone, to eliminate the attitudes, the vices that hold you back From coming to me fully. Understand that these are instants before which you must go in haste. The day is agonizing before the night that has come earlier than expected, and before the mighty sun, the night hides again. The day and night rush, one to decline and the other to hide. Time is not time; It was greatly shortened and it will be shortened even more, before an earth that will shake with force. I see, with my heart pierced by suffering, how I am avoided by the human word. My people deny the existence of the place of fire in which souls suffer because of their bad behaviour in life. In hell souls suffer enormously before my absence; the punishment is very painful. Evil has taken the hearts of the enraged man. Pray, make reparation, convert and turn to my Mercy. I do not abandon any of those who come to me repentant. I just wait for a Word in order to heal you, to invite you to my table. How much debate over the fulfilment of each one of the prophecies! … and when you have Them in front of you, you do not recognize them. I have been cast out from the heart of man. My name that is above all name, is no longer heard. The youth have lost every value, the men dress in silk and the women dress like men. My representatives do not love us, my Mother and I, as they should love us. Communism grows, the weapons of destruction move in dangerous hands. Hate increases among the nations. Hunger walks the earth. Innocents are exterminated. The family is disintegrated. Technology has created massive concentration camps in homes. Man does not value life. Drugs are overabundant without control. You have buried my commandments so as not to feel remorse. My Mother that pilgrims throughout the world in search of souls, is despised and rejected. My body and blood are not received worthily. I am profaned time and time again. You present yourselves before me dressed unworthily. I am despised time and time again. False prophets proliferate, evil has seized souls. Nature scourges man time and time again before the sin increasing without control. The winds of war are heard everywhere. The dragon has awakened. The path of the antichrist has been opened; the seal is placed On man unceremoniously. My temples lie empty. How many signs! … and you do not wake up! My children, a political event will invade humanity with terror. My Church is flogged. It is time for prayer, for unity and for coming close to me. I do not abandon you, even though the darkness may come, my light will not leave you. Keep faith in my promise of protection, of love and of blessing. I am waiting, come to me! My faithful will remain in my hand. I am a king waiting for his faithful people. Remain in my peace. Your Jesus. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin.",,,,,,,
2010,12,1,Holy Mary,December,"Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I love you. My heart remains upon all of humanity, upon all of humanity. My Mantle has fallen upon each human child to protect him in these instants in which Mankind no longer walks; mankind no longer walks. It is drawn; it is drawn towards The fulfilment of the great events that will mark the future of this earth. Hunger will scourge all the earth. I invite you promptly to take the necessary previsions. A great battle looms on a spiritual level. From there comes my insistent call to fortify Yourselves in prayer, in confession, in the Eucharistic nourishment, otherwise you Will not be able to resist. My hand supports you and will support you; do not fear. My Son respects man’s will. From you must be born the desire to come and receive the Eucharistic nourishment daily. Many of my children cling to the idea that without causing Their brothers and sisters harm, they can live a good spirituality. And that is true, but they Will not merge, they will not soar through the spiritual heights, if they do not fulfil the Commandments and the sacraments of the Church. ‘prayer face to face with my Son’ is necessary. It is necessary to confess sins, reconciliation is necessary. It is necessary to love without measure. It is necessary to receive the Eucharist. Beloved of my heart, how much pain is in me! How much pain before so much adversity upon humanity! How my maternal heart wishes to present to you a different panorama From the one I must transmit to you, beloved children! Mankind no longer walks. Have this present, ‘a magnet’; in this generation all of the Events announced during so many, many years converge like a magnet. They converge for Their fulfilment before the maximum degree of sin that man has reached. Your responsibility is to all form an unbreakable, strong chain; it is uniting shoulder to Shoulder in order to elevate to heaven an infinite wall of love, since this will be what Will minimize in great measure what is coming, but it will not annul it. An event will shake the world, and you must pray without tiring so that your brothers and Sisters who stagger, do not fall. Pray, my beloved, pray for Chile. Pray, beloved children of my heart, for Brazil. Pray for Bolivia. Pray because water will reach the coasts of the United States and purify it. Pray, my beloved, pray for Spain. Pray, pray for Argentina. Pray, pray for Costa Rica. My beloved, awareness of the promptitude of the coming events is urgent. Man has challenged his God and he has responded with Infinite Mercy. Now in this moment, It is all of creation that desires to pay tribute to its creator, purifying mankind as it happened In the past. I invite you to take purity to the innocents. That their eyes may not see that fatal mirror that man has placed before his eyes. Thus, with that purity, with that maternal love With which I lull my child, thus I desire that all the souls bring out from their being that parenthood hidden in every woman and in every man so that with your prayers softened and pure, you bring comfort to the innocents that suffer and that will suffer greatly with the coming moments of tragedy that await man. I invite you to be true testimonies of fraternal love. I invite you to be conscious of this moment. How much my maternal heart hurts! Calling so much, calling so much…. And I continue to Be ignored! How much my maternal heart hurts, because you will have to suffer greatly for you to cry Out to me! How is it that you will have to seek me out of pain and not out of love? How is it that the tragedies that come soon upon many and many lands, will be the ones to? Make some, only some turn towards my Son again? How is it that in this moment my children’s heart has ceased to be of flesh and the great Divine sculptor, with a chisel, has to remove the rock that covers man’s heart in order to Find within a little piece of flesh? How my heart hurts before so many millions of children that hand themselves over to the Antichrist! Beloved children, I invite you to bless the land where you live and to bless the whole world. Bless constantly and bless yourselves and declare yourselves property of Jesus Christ my Son. Declare with your word, that evil will not prevail against you. This your Mother, clothed with the sun, will rescue you and holding your Hand I will present you before my Son. Remain in my Son’s peace, remain in my love. Mother Mary.

2010,12,6,Holy Mary,December,"Beloved children of my Immaculate Heart, I bless you along with your families. I bless the eyes that read my appeals, meditate them and live them In practice every day. Children, the sun remains in the firmament and you see it shine daily, it gives you heat and seems to do nothing. If the sun goes away, you feel cold and you fear the darkness. My Son always remains faithful to his children. It seems to you that he does nothing, and He does everything. He gives you everything that you need. But you distance yourselves Voluntarily, without realizing that if you turn away from him, you become lost, and your Heart turns to stone, without feelings. You do not realize that the darkness seizes the human Being when he or she does not have God. The path of every man remains lit. No path is given with darkness. It is the will of each Human being that darkens their own path. Children, pray the Holy Rosary each day. This is a weapon against evil’s attacks. Anoint the Frames of the external doors of your homes with holy water; but it is more helpful that you Anoint yourselves with the fulfilment of the commandments and of the sacraments, also Reconciling yourselves with my Son and receiving him in the Eucharist. Children, why do you sleep? Wake up! You do not see the signs. Words of peace are approaching in the middle east. These are only the anteroom of war. Sin leads humankind to approach the apostasy every instant. I invite you to turn to the Eucharist, inexhaustible source of graces, so that you strengthen your faith, before Controversy seizes the Church and they lead you by paths of perdition with a false religion. Masonry is usurping the Church, undermining it little by little and smoothing out the path Of the impostor. Evil sits, preparing the persecution of my children. You my faithful, preserve tradition, cling to it, do not succumb before false modernisms. My Son is the same, yesterday, today and always. Do not pay attention to those who give dates about the events. Nature itself clarifies the Signs. The events tell you, wake up! Why do you sleep? Pray without rest, pray, unite, convert. Pray for Italy, do not abandon it in your prayers. It will suffer a great scourge. Pray for Spain, it has forgotten my Son. It will weep. Pray for Africa. Pray for Portugal. Pray, communism rises before the astonishment of the world, which will suffer. The earth continues to tremble in the face of human sin. Man suffers because of it, death Arrives silently. The earth opens before a surprised, hurt, but unrepentant man. Who blames God for his griefs? Man. Who has despised my calls? Man. Who has abused of his freedom? Man. Who loves, forgiving? God. Children, do not deny the responsibility before all the facts that arise in this moment. Do not Deny a just purification. Wake up. See the signs, the seasons are not marked by months, But by days. The entire cosmos remains immersed in a single voice; ‘purification’. Children, apostles of these instants, pray and give testimony of divine love. I invite you, beloved apostles, to submerge yourselves in the Divine Will, so that fused; you are light Of the nations in the midst of so much darkness. Blood will run, man will regret. The earth burns, water does not put it out. Beloved, the purification will bring the victory of the light over the darkness. The Church will rise triumphant; pain will be transformed by joy. The prayers of the just are The wall of my Son’s people. Do not fear, I remain beside those who are mine to guide them. I bless you. Mother Mary. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. ",,,,,,,
2010,12,8,Holy Mary,December,"My beloved, I bless you. You are the fruit of my womb, of my unconditional fiat To the Trinitarian Will. I love you. Once more I invite you to renew the consecration to my Immaculate Heart; I invite you to Renew the consecration of all that you possess, to my Immaculate Heart. The most holy Trinity has entrusted to me at these instants the care of the Church and as a Loving Mother, I continuously lay out the path so that you don’t get lost. I announce to you All that is going to happen so that you convert, and what is coming does not take you by Surprise. I speak to you in place after place, in language after language and in path after Path, so that all of my children remain vigilant and alert in the face of the events that arise In these crucial instants of this generation. Do not pay attention to those who announce the end of the world; this is a Trinitarian Jurisdiction, but it is well certain that this generation must be purified time and time again, Since they have banished their king, they have sent him far away, they have confined him To oblivion and you do not obey my calls. You deny me constantly, you call me time and Time again, because you believe that denying me and constantly calling me false in me Apparitions and accusing my true prophets, you desire in this way to deny me, in order to Drive me from the hearts of my children and that these continue to fall time and time again In the multiple sins that humanity forges, instant by instant. I invite you to unite yourselves to the ranks of fidelity. If you had faith the size of a mustard seed you would never stagger, you would not fear. Who fears? Who are the ones that deny my true prophets? Who are the ones that deny me? Word and my calls? Those who live in sin and fear; they fear because they sin constantly. I invite you not to stagger. Though you see the sun darken, though you see the moon become bloodstained, though You see the stars become dim, do not stagger in faith. Though you see the waters rise over lands and create a new geography with this, do not Fear, do not stagger in faith. Though you see the plague come with unknown diseases before which science will not be Able to create new ways to stop it, do not stagger in faith. Invoke me, hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. But with faith the Size of a mustard seed. All will be kept away from you and from your Families, with faith. Though you live in the midst of war, though you feel hunger in the flesh, do not let faith Stagger. Though you are persecuted by the enemy of the Church, though you are victims of those Who will apostatize, do not let faith stagger. The almighty one is and will be with this faithful people and this Mother that is here before you do not abandon you, because I am the Weapon of the New Covenant. Evangelize with your testimony. I need warriors of love in these instants. Before love Everything melts, all evil falls. Be warriors of my Son’s love, may love be nourished with Your faith. May each pore of your skin exhale love towards your brothers and sisters. The Faithful church will fight with love and be triumphant, and it will rise jubilant dressed with purity and dignity. For now, maintain unity, do not involve yourselves in passing conversations that lead you to Decay spiritually. Fight with the word of love, fight with the feeling of love, fight with love; Be testimonies of the work and actions of my Son. Do not forget that you are my children, And that at every moment this Mother pronounced fiat to the Trinitarian Will. At this moment I invite you again to prayer, to strong and disinterested prayer, to prayer that Is from heart to heart, from mind to mind, from spirit to spirit, to prayer in a single heart, Beside my heart. I invite you to renew yourselves through prayer, coming fully and Confidently to the Trinitarian Will. I invite you to give love in exchange for nothing, of nothing human. I invite you to be Temples of the Holy Spirit, worthy, pure, chaste, denying yourselves in order to please the Trinity. Be conscious of the decay of this humanity that must be purified. Do not let faith stagger even though you see the hills open, even though the mountains and ranges tremble and fall And the plains prevail, do not let faith stumble. The earth opens because it cries out to man it demands man a change. There is so much Sin upon the earth that it opens, speaking to man who blind and deaf, does not listen to nature. The cold will permeate the entrails to resemble man the cold the soul lives without Its God, and this is a slight varnish. The mounts, the lands will be covered with white, with a whiteness that demands nature, trying to hide the blackness of sin. Pray, pray for the United States. Prayer is precise. Pray for Brazil. It is in need of your prayers. Pray for India. Death will pass over it. Do not forget to pray for the whole world. Pray for yourselves so that you remain strong and confident. Do not Separate yourselves from the Eucharist, fulfil the commandments and The sacraments. Do not let faith stagger. Though you see the Church shake, do not stagger. Hell, the demons Will not prevail against her. But the Church must be purified. This generation must be purified, because it has banished its God. But here I am, do not fear. This your Mother is beside each one of you, I guide you. Invoke, Hail Mary most pure, conceived without sin. I go to the ends of the earth. I dwell in the heart of all those that cry Out to me. Here I am, your Mother, do not fear, do not fear, do not fear... Here I am, each one of you adorns my maternal mantle. Each one fills me with joy with His prayers and his fidelity to my Son. You are the joyful fruit of my womb. Onward My people! Onward! Be fulfillers of my Son’s mission. I love you; I bless you, remain in peace, in my maternal heart. Mother Mary.

2010,12,12,Holy Mary,December,"Beloved children of my heart, I bless you. The shepherd comes for his flock. Walk, do not stop; heed my calls. Do not get held up by worldly temptations. God does not Abandon those who are his. He waits for them to sit them at his table. Do not contaminate yourselves with the mundane and fleeting. Do not fall into the sins that The devil places before men. You, faithful people, keep the faith, receive the Eucharist and Be fulfillers of the commandments.

I call you to take courage, my children, before the human heart is pierced by pain, in the Face of the death of some of my consecrated ones that will rise up in defence of my beloved Supreme pontiff. The Church will be persecuted more, the lament will extend throughout The earth. My faithful shall be persecuted. Do not feel this is far away, you will be amazed. The devil has poisoned the human mind so that will they kill one of my prophets. The fire does not stop, it rises to the surface, and men will suffer. Water comes in company With pain. Pray for Indonesia. Death will pass. Pray for Mexico. It will drink bitterness. Pray for Hungary. It will weep. Monarchy will be scourged by man. Children, how you wound my Son’s heart! You attend to hear mass, but do not come to live it. Dishonest clothes hurt my Son and this Mother. The body’s clothes are not correct to Remain before the king of heaven and earth. ‘the body’s clothes denote the state of the Soul.’ I suffer for it. Be aware of the value of life, of the urgency of conversion, of the responsibility that you acquire by being those who know my calls. Beloved children of my heart, the purification is nearer to men. Do not forget my calls. Protect my prophets. Prepare yourselves spiritually; the cosmos sheds its tears upon this generation. Prepare yourselves, hunger has come to mankind. My calls will echo in the human mind, that it has not notice them. Day has taken time away from the day, night has taken time away from the night, only the moment remains. Only an instant in order to fulfil the great act that the will of the most holy Trinity has Entrusted to you. Prepare yourselves, people of God. Walk with faith. My Son has his paths, continue with Faith. Children, do not fear. Pray so that you continue the path. Strength is given to you from on high. Pray, receive my Son in the Eucharist. Children, do not delay. Maintain the faith, my hand remains before each one of you to intercede before my Son. Consecrate yourselves to my heart, I impregnate you with my love. You remain in me.

Once again, I invite you to conversion, I urge you to conversion. Time and time again I call My people and they refuse to listen to me. Sin does not have a face at this moment, it has Multiple masks that mankind places on it with great innovation. The earthly is the joy of the human heart. And I, I am forgotten time and time again. As Father I do not tire in my Infinite Mercy to call you time and time again. I do not tire of remaining in you. What would become of man if I did not dwell within him? What would Become of man? You cannot even imagine it; they suffer this grief in hell. My dearly beloved people, sincerely turn your gaze inward and you will note how much Souls disguise themselves when you come to my temple. With how much foolishness they Come to me without repentance, but with vainglory. Without desires of conversion, but With many false promises, forgetting that I, that I know you in your entrails. You do not deceive me; you deceive yourselves damning yourselves voluntarily. You blame me time And time again for mankind’s fluctuations, and I, and I forgive you time and time again… Pray, pray for New Zealand.

He, Carrying my Cross, will suffer. Pray for one another, do not disguise love. Do not love with human Passion. Love with my very love so that you truly love.
